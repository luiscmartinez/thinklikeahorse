											<br><br>
											Motivation:<br>
											<br>
											A barefoot horse is capable of performing all the tasks that could be
											expected of a horse, without requiring any kind of protection of the hoof,
											PROVIDED that the hoof has not been weakened or deformed by the actions of
											man through unnatural treatment and living conditions.<br>
											<br>
											When looking at literature dealing with hooves, the one constant reference
											is the damaging effect of shoes. For about 200 years, the ill effects of
											shoeing have been increasingly documented.<br>
											<br>
											The textbook written by I.C. Gross, teacher of shoeing at the Royal
											Veterinary School of Stuttgart, clearly states in the preface that "the
											question of whether shoeing is the means by which to keep hooves sound, is
											to answered in the negative."<br>
											<br>
											The fact that two of the main causes of the reduced life expectancy of
											domestic horses (in Europe, about 1/3 of the natural lifespan) are hoof and
											leg problems is disturbing and should be cause for research.<br>
											<br>
											Scientific Publications:<br>
											<br>
											That hooves are as hard and resistant to wear as the ground to which they
											become accustomed is ancient knowledge, already put into writing 2400 years
											ago by Xenophon, military leader of the Greek cavalry. The argument that
											"our trails are so rocky, the hooves wear down too much" is thus made
											invalid, since it is not the hoof, but the living conditions of the horse
											that cause the problem. Xenophon"s observations have been proved many
											thousands of times over; in more recent times (1986), Alexander and Colles
											once again reminded the riding and veterinary community of this truth with
											their article "Shoeing--an unnecessary evil" in the American Equine
											Veterinary Journal.<br>
											<br>
											Bracy Clark, scientist at the London Veterinary College around 1800, found
											out that every shoe, no matter how correctly applied, inevitably forces the
											hoof to contract from year to year. He moreover lamented the fact that the
											books on equine anatomy portrayed these deformed, contracted hooves as sound
											hooves, since his veterinary colleagues obviously studied only the (sick)
											hooves of their patients, not sound hooves. This problem, unfortunately, is
											still largely present today: there is rarely a hoof shown in veterinary or
											farrier textbooks which is not a contracted hoof, yet described as a normal,
											sound foot.<br>
											<br>
											DVM Zierold, under Professor Lungwitz in 1910, examined and compared the
											corium of shod and never shod horses, and found significant differences in
											structure, in that the corium of a shod horse is of a quality which makes
											the connection to the hoof capsule less stable (a factor in laminitis, for
											example).<br>
											<br>
											Luca Bein, in his 1983 dissertation in Zurich, measured the shock absorption
											of barefoot, shod, and alternately shod horses. He concluded that a
											conventionally shod horse shows an absence of 60-80% of the hoof"s natural
											shock absorption. He demonstrated that "a shod foot on asphalt at a walk
											receives THREE TIMES the impact force as an unshod horse on asphalt at the
											trot." Bein also found that a shoe vibrates at about 800 Hz, damaging living
											tissue.<br>
											<br>
											Dr. C.C. Pollit, at the University of Queensland, Australia, showed in his
											1993 study of circulation in the hoof that a shod hoof is not supplied with
											blood in the normal fashion, but through an alternate route.<br>
											<br>
											Professor Smedegards" publications make clear that shoeing prevents the hoof
											mechanism from working, if for no other reason that the horse is forced to
											walk unnaturally (the whole hoof impacts the ground at the same time, and
											the horse cannot break over naturally). A normal hoof contacts the ground
											first at the rear and side, then breaks over.<br>
											<br>
											So from various sources throughout history, we can see it is known that;<br>
											<br>
											1. shoeing causes the foot to become contracted (Clark)<br>
											<br>
											2. shoeing causes a deviance of the normal laminae structure (Zierold)<br>
											<br>
											3. the impact forces with each shod step are much greater, and the vibration
											of the shoe is damaging (Bein)<br>
											<br>
											4. circulation is decreased through shoeing (Pollitt) 5. the side walls, at
											the widest part of the hoof, have to be able to move outward (Smedegard)<br>
											<br>
											All these are veterinary professionals, though there are many other
											scientists who have added interesting dissertations to this topic.<br>
											<br>
											Personal Observations:<br>
											<br>
											"Hoof mechanism" is the term given to the movement of the hoof capsule. It
											has long been known and measured that, when weightbearing, the downward
											force of the skeleton on the front wall of the hoof capsule forces the
											coronet band, at its highest point, to sink downward and inward. This
											illustration is well known and accepted.<br>
											<br>
											However, the downward-inward movement of the coronet band is possible only
											if the neighboring side walls can move outwards, or can sink into soft
											ground. This movement is coupled with the flattening of the concave sole,
											which makes room for the descending coffin bone.<br>
											<br>
											This way, the solar corium is not bruised but rather is relaxed, and the
											capillaries in the sole and wall fill with blood. It is also known, and
											clearly illustratable (through infrared photography) that shod feet are
											cool, whereas unshod feet are warm.<br>
											<br>
											This means that, at the widest part of the hoof (not only in the area of the
											heel), a considerable expansion of the hoof capsule takes place upon
											weightbearing. The wall expands NOT ONLY in the rearmost third of the hoof,
											as shown in many textbooks. Elementary pythagorean geometry supports this.
											For a normal warmblood, the concave sole must sink down about lcm, which
											necessitates an expansion of the wall of about lmm to each side. At higher
											speeds, the bulb of the heel contacts the ground first, which adds to the
											widening of the foot. Repeatedly, expansion of up to 4mm to each side have
											been found through live "prints" at the trot and canter.<br>
											<br>
											A shod hoof is unable to expand as necessary, the concave sole cannot draw
											flat, and the solar corium is bruised as a result. When trimming such
											hooves, these bruises become visible.<br>
											<br>
											To get back to L. Bein"s findings on shock absorption. The expansion of the
											hoof capsule complete with the flattening of the sole absorb up to 80% of
											the impact force. In terms of physics, this is conversion of of energy
											through reversible deformation.<br>
											<br>
											The consequences of the lack of up to 80% of shock absorption are widely
											known as arthritis, tendonitis, etc. The damage done is all the greater when
											the horse is young, and the still-developing coffm bone is handicapped in
											its development to proper size through shoeing. Shoeing a horse under 3 (or
											even 2) years results in crippled and deformed coffin bones and steep,
											contracted hooves.<br>
											<br>
											The negative effect of shoes on joints and tendons is increased through
											stresses during motion, ie. the weight of the shoe stressing the joint and
											tendon through centripedal force. The heavier the shoe, the greater this
											force.<br>
											<br>
											The contracting effect of shoes increases from day to day, since the hoof
											grows continually, not straight down but in a conical shape. The hoof grows
											in width, but the shoe does not; after a month, the hoof grew by 1 cm, in
											length and width; with a shoe, only in length, forcing a constriction of the
											corium.<br>
											<br>
											That a horse with such damage is still able to walk is due largely to the
											fact that the nerves have mostly become nonfunctional. As soon as the shoes
											are removed, circulation begins to return, and after a while the nerves
											"come back to life." So the damage will be present for years before the
											horse goes lame (due to inflammation, which brings circulation, and as such
											nerve activity).<br>
											<br>
											The lack of circulation grows more severe with lack of movement. A shod
											horse which is worked all day tilling the field, for example, has better
											circulation than a shod horse standing in a box stall and ridden an hour a
											week.<br>
											<br>
											With a reduction of circulation, metabolism at a cellular level is also
											adversely effected. Excess protein is not used in the building of tissue
											(ie. horn) but builds up in the organism (laminits, etc.)<br>
											<br>
											The results of vibration have not yet been studied in horses. In human
											medicine, comparable effects exist in people working with vibrating tools
											such as saws, etc. Raynaud"s Syndrome, a condition showing alteration in
											blood vessels, is one of the problems associated with vibration. Laminitic
											horses show comparable alterations in their blood vessels, so vibration of
											shoes may be a factor in this.<br>
											<br>
											Shoes change the way the horse"s foot meets the ground. On soft ground, into
											which they sink, they have a stronger than normal breaking action; on rock,
											asphalt and ice, they slip unnaturally. These unnatural actions have to be
											compensated for by muscles and ligaments, and can eventually lead to
											shoulder and hip problems. Logic would tell us that it is nonsensical to
											treat the symptoms without removing the cause.<br>
											<br>
											A reduction of the damaging effects is found in horses whose hooves are
											regularly exposed to water, so that the horn can at least retain its
											elasticity. This explains to a great deal the seemingly problem-free, long
											period in which a horse may be ridden while shod: highly active lifestyle in
											a wet climate.<br>
											<br>
											Today, many hooves are brittle and dried out to the point of having lost
											their natural elasticity, which by itself can lead to shock absorption and
											circulatory reduction.<br>
											<br>
											There are no statistics about lasting damage from the kicks of shod horses;
											certain is that many people would be alive if the horse"s hoof which caught
											them in the head had not been shod.<br>
											<br>
											Orthopedic shoes are heavier, more tightly attached, and the already
											damaging effects are magnified on an ill foot. Pressure on the frog or the
											sole causes a steepening of the coffin bone through the horse"s attempt to
											evade the painful pressure. The result is that the angle between coffm bone
											and middle phalanx decreases. The digital arteries are squeezed shut just
											outside the coffin bone. This gives a good deal of relief from pain, since
											the nerves are prevented from working, but healing is obviously not a
											consequence of this situation. This is especially true of the wedge
											pads.<br>
											<br>
											A lesser, but still existent evil is the damaging effect of nails, vibrating
											inside the horn capsule.<br>
											<br>
											EFFECTS OF "PROPER" SHOEING:<br>
											<br>
											1. CONTRACTED HOOVES - the hoof meets the ground in a different way, since
											the horse is trying to evade the pain in the heel area, leads to muscle,
											tendon, and joint problems<br>
											<br>
											2. BRUISING OF CORIUM - leads to lack of circulation, changes in metabolism
											leading to decreased horn formation and poor quality of horn, problems in
											the laminae, lack of sensation in the sole leading to tripping, etc.,
											suspected problems in the metabolic rate of organs<br>
											<br>
											3. INCREASED IMPACT FORCES - lead to bruising, tearing, strains with
											morphological changes in the corium, the hoof cartilage and joints, tendons,
											even hoof cancer<br>
											<br>
											4. VIBRATION - leads to similar damages as in humans (vascular changes;
											Raynaud"s disease)<br>
											<br>
											5. WEIGHT OF SHOES - puts strain on the joint capsules and leads to
											periostosis, arthritis, and increased damage on injury<br>
											<br>
											6. CHANGE IN IMPACT - unnatural mechanics lead to muscle and tendon
											damage<br>
											<br>
											7. NAIL HOLES - destroy the horn wall and decrease elasticity<br>
											<br>
											8. METABOLISM DISRUPTIONS - lead to organic damage In every case, shoeing
											presents unnecessary harm to the horse--unnecessary, if the horse"s
											biological needs are met.<br>
											<br>
											<i>END of reprint</i> These facts are hard to argue with, but I assure no
											one who makes a living putting on shoes will agree with any of this.

										<p align="justify">The picture above is a great example of the working hoof and
											how it supports weight and flexes as a horse walks and moves and how this
											action increases blood flow and keeps the hoof healthy. All of these actions
											helps provide the horse with padding and shock absorption for the hoof and

											<strong>Pros to Barefoot Hooves:</strong><br>
											<br>
											A healthy foot does not need shoes for protection<br>
											The hoof flexes naturally<br>
											Hoof grows normally<br>
											Blood flow is increased<br>
											Greater traction from the hoof expansion and flattening out<br>
											Better shock absorption<br>
											The digital cushion is allowed to assisting in shock absorption and blood

											The frog gets pressure assisting in blood flow

											<strong>Cons to Shod Hooves:</strong><br>
											<br>
											Horseshoes restrict blood flow<br>
											Shoes numb the foot from lack of blood (this is why horses go lame when
											shoes are removed)<br>
											No hoof expansion with a shoe<br>
											Hoof flexing is prevented<br>
											Shoes on a hoof is like putting a clamp on a hose<br>
											Many forms of lameness are linked to shoes<br>
											Shoes change and affect the coffin bone and prevent the frog from
											functioning<br>
											A shod hoof loses 60 to 80% of the hoof"s natural shock absorption<br>
											Shoes cause three times the pounding force and pressure to the hoof

										<p align="justify"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In 1983, Luca Bein, did a dissertation
											on the shock absorption of a barefoot hoof compared to a shod hoof. His
											finding were that <strong>a conventionally shod hoof loses 60 to 80% of the
												hoof"s natural shock absorption.</strong> Bein also demonstrated that a
											shod hoof on asphalt, at a walk, receives <strong>THREE TIMES (3X)</strong>
											the <u>impact force</u> as as a <strong>barefoot hoof on asphalt at the
												trot.</strong> Bein found a shoe on a hoof vibrates at about 800 Hertz
											(Hz), which at that level does damage to living tissue. <i>Think about that,
												a metal shoe that is nailed into a healthy hoof compromises the hoof
												wall, triples the impact force of every step, prevents blood flow,
												damages living tissue, prevents expansion of the hoof, restricts the
												natural flexing of the hoof, prevents normal growth of the hoof and yet
												people still put shoes on horses.</i></p>

											<strong>Questions about Barefoot Verses Shod Horses:</strong>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Shoes increase the impact of every step a horse takes, that
											causes more pounding to legs, joints and tendons. If you do not believe this
											put a metal plate in YOUR shoe and then go jog on hard pavement and rocks,
											then you will get it.<br>
											<br>
											Shoes prevents the hoof from doing naturally flexing, that prevents good
											blood flow.<br>
											<br>
											Shoes do not allow the hoof to grow, so when the hoof grows with shoe it
											rips the nails, it puts stress on the hoof and creates pain and damage to
											the hoof.<br>
											<br>
											Metal shoes give more protection to the hoof when a rider is lazy and just
											wants to run the horse over any terrain, rocks, hard surface and is too lazy
											to pay attention when they ride.<br>
											<br>
											Therefore, when people ask, why do older experienced horse people still use
											shoes, read the above again.<br>
											<br>
											Nails to hold shoes on, puncture the hoof wall and allow bacteria to get in
											the hoof and cause abscesses, nails get ripped out if the shoe gets hung up
											on things and destroys more of the hoof when they are ripped out with the
											head still on.<br>
											<br>
											Why do people only shoe the front feet or only the rear feet: Since a horse
											carries 70% of it"s weight on the front legs the front hooves tend to get
											more issues, lameness or abscesses. Putting shoes only on the rear feet only
											could be for helping a horse slide more when they stop, since some thinks it
											is cool or gets more points at shows.<br>
											<br>
											It is easier and a short cut to make your horse wear shoes just so you can
											ride him over rocks thinking it will not hurt them. Actually, since shoes
											weaken the hoof, walking a horse over rocks and hard surfaces causes more
											injuries than if the horse had a strong healthy, unshod hoof that would be
											stronger and heal better.<br>
											<br>
											I do not care what others say about shoes - <strong>There are none so blind
												as those that to not want to see.</strong> - The evidence is clear,
											SHOES, like bits and spurs, are old archaic methods when people did not know
											any better - now that we do know better, those that still use these archaic
											ways are not only foolish, but they are NOT true Horsemen.

												<h3><strong>Understanding Hoof Care:</strong></h3>
												<p align="justify">Like many things in horses, <strong>"it is a process
														and not an event",</strong> so trying to fix a hoof or correct a
													horse in one trimming just makes matters worse. It takes a full
													year, thereabout, for a hoof to grow out completely. Another old
													horse saying is <strong>"the hoof you care for today - is the hoof
														you will ride on in a year".</strong> This means that when
													horses are neglected and are not given proper hoof care, it cannot
													be fixed in one or two trimmings. It takes time and <strong>"if you
														take the time it takes - it will take less time".</strong> So I
													see and hear people and Farriers claim to fix a hoof in one trim, it
													just ain"t so and can"t be done. You can start in the right
													direction; you can relieve pain, balance the hoof, start the repair
													process, but no hoof is fixed or made perfect in one trimming.<br>
													<br>
													However, you can ruin a hoof in one trimming very easily. Which is
													why it is so important that you understand the mechanics of the hoof
													and know how it works, so you don"t buy into that foolishness that
													is being repeated throughout the horse world, mainly by people that
													don"t know and people "that have owned horses their entire life".
													Two horse sayings that fit here: <strong>"If you take the time it
														takes, it will take less time" and "The slow way is the fast way
														with horses."</strong>
												</p>
												<p></p>
												<hr>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify"><u><strong>Reference Glue on Shoes:</strong></u></p>
												<p align="justify">This is a new thing and is better than nailing metal
													shoes to the hoof wall and punching holes in the hoof wall with
													nails, which compromises the hoof wall, punctures the sealed hoof
													wall and subjects the Horse hoof to infection, abscess or bacteria.
													The next time you see a Farrier take off an old shoe from a horse,
													pay close attention to the hoof. Look at how the wall is dead about
													the nails, look at the rotting type action that occurs about the
													nails and where the metal shoe has restricted growth and blood flow.
													If you look closely, it is very easy to see how unhealthy the hoof
													is because of the shoe. However, with a fresh trim, some nipper
													work, some file work and a shinny shoe, the hoof looks all pretty
													again. What people don"t see is the rotting and damage that just
													starts over until the next change of shoes.</p>
												<p align="justify">Shoes and nails still restrict the natural flexing,
													expanding and contraction of the hoof. It still puts unnecessary
													pressure on the hoof wall, still puts unnatural pressure on the hoof
													and still makes the hoof weaker in the long term, since it does not
													allow for natural and normal growth, blood flow and strength. So
													once again, trying to do something to improve or help a horse still
													goes against the natural growth and hoof development and ends up
													doing more damage than letting Mother Nature do what it does best.
													Barefoot is best.</p>

													<strong><u>"Horse Shoes Are Bad For Horses"</u></strong><u></u>
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Basic hoof care</strong> is not that hard,
													but it takes time. So trying to rush it or force it only makes it
													take longer. Like most things with horses, "the slow way is the fast
													way". So just picking the feet regularly really is a great way to
													prevent and spot problems. Picking the feet does many things that
													people don"t see. It teaches a horse to have his feet handled, it
													forces you to spend time with your horse, it develops muscles in
													your back which will help your riding, it shows dominance over the
													horse since you move his feet up and down and take away his ability
													to flee or run and most importantly it trains your EYE.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Training your eye</strong> is a process not
													an event. It takes years of seeing good and bad hooves to know what
													is normal and what is not. A trained eye is something that needs to
													be constantly refreshed. The eye is trained over years and years of
													looking at good and bad hooves. Seeing hooves daily helps you know
													what looks normal and what looks odd or out of place. This is how
													the eye gets trained. Which is why the misconception is alive and
													well that horseshoes are good? Since many use shoes and have always
													seen shoes on horses, they think that is normal. It is not and it is
													not good for the horse. I am linking many hoof sites to this page.
													Visit these sites and view all the pictures of good and bad hooves,
													train your eye to you know what you are seeing and what to look for.
													This is not something people naturally have or comes without work;
													they have to learn it. If you just look at your horse"s feet, you
													will never understand the hoof. It takes 1000"s of hooves to start
													being able to recognize good from bad. Some hoof chips are
													insignificant while others are very critical. Knowing the difference
													can save your horse lots of problems. So invest time viewing and
													reading all you can about the hoof. Watch Farriers work on feet, ask
													questions, notice the hoof before the trim and after the trim. This,
													like most all things with horses, is not easy and is not fast. If
													you invest on the front end you will save much more time and effort
													later and it will be better for your horse.</p>
												<p align="justify">Another common misconception out there is that all
													hooves should look the same. This is not true; all hooves are rarely
													exactly same. Each hoof can be a little different; trimming all
													hooves the same can cause problems. If a Farrier or horse shoer is
													making your horse"s hooves look the same, then he is not doing your
													horse or you any favors. There are certain aspects of a hoof that
													mainly deal with "balance". Balance is important in many ways, but
													absolute uniformity is not the same as a well balanced hoof. If you
													view the links I have placed on the pictures and at the bottom of
													this page you will start to see what balance is and will hear this
													common theme from horse hoof experts.</p>

													<strong><u>SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE HOOF AND BAREFOOT
															TRIMS:</u></strong>
												</center><strong><u></u></strong><u></u>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">A horse walks about seven to eight thousand steps a
													day in Pasture. A horse only walks less than 600 steps a day in a
													stall. This has negative consequences to blood flow, wear, exercise,
													flexing, frog stimulation and preventing all that is not good for
													the hoof.</p>
												<p align="justify">Everything your horse eats will affect the feet.
													Some, such as excess sugars, grains and any toxins will have a very
													negative effect, while a well balanced diet will be beneficial to
													help keep the hoof health. Minerals, such as copper and zinc are
													essential for good hoof health. Too much iron is NOT good for the
													hoof. Although a mineral block and salt block is important, they may
													not provide everything needed.</p>
												<p align="justify">Clean water and hydration helps the hoof. Having
													clean cool water in summer and warm water in winter helps a horse
													drink more and that is good for the hoof.</p>
												<p align="justify">Hoof care and trimming are very important to a
													healthy hoof. Regular trimming keeps the hoof stronger, more
													balanced, shaped correctly and pressure points are reduced by
													keeping the hoof appearing flat, but actually level by smoothing off
													any lumps or bumps in the sole.</p>
												<p align="justify">Laminitis is inflammation in the hoof. In my
													experience, Laminitis and abscesses are the most common form of hoof
													issues. So keep in mind, adequate exercise, proper diet, clean water
													and correct trimming will create and encourage a healthy hoof.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Remember:</strong> The front hooves carry
													more weight and pressure than the rear. <strong><u>Front hooves pull
															and back hooves push.</u></strong><u></u> Notice in the
													picture below how this happens.</p>

												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">With this in mind, front hooves hit the ground harder
													and have more impact. Using easy boots or other type boot on the
													front feet is beneficial if you are riding on rocky or hard terrain,
													working longer or harder, or if the horse has been kept on soft or
													wet terrain making the hoof softer. A healthy hoof should not need
													boots.</p>

												<div class="indented">
													<p align="justify"><strong><u>TWO KEY BAREFOOT TRIMMING
																POINTS:</u></strong><u></u> Rounding the hoof edge,
														commonly called a Mustang roll, helps prevents chips and
														increases hoof strength. <strong>SCOOPING,</strong> putting a
														slight scoop on the sides or quarters of the hoof, helps aid in
														flexing of the hoof when the horse walks (also called: Pooling).
														Here is two pictures of a scooped hoof, notice the raised
														portion of the hoof. When pressure is placed on the hoof, the
														front and rear hoof flattens and the scoop allows for flexing.

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong><u></u> You will NOT see

														<strong><u>WARNING ON HOOF CONDITIONERS:</u></strong>
													</center><strong><u></u></strong><u></u>
													<p></p>
													<p align="justify">Hoof oils, lotions, conditions or treatments can
														do more damage than good - if over used. These things soften the
														hooves. Using them one or twice a month may be OK, but NOT sure
														they are beneficial. Using them any more <strong><u>will harm
																and make the hoof weak, slows growth, increases chipping
																and compromises a healthy hoof.</u></strong><u></u></p>

												<hr>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">I got a question about how do horses in the wild get
													rocks out of their feet if no one picks them out. In the wild horses
													walk more, the run more, they get drinks in mud and ponds, they
													cross streams, and all of these things help remove objects from the
													hoof. When a horse kicks out at another horse or predator, that
													snapping action removes things from hooves. When a horse stands or
													walks in mud, that suction removes things from the hoof. When mud
													dries in a hoof and then when the horse runs, that dried mud flies
													off and pulls things from the hoof. When a horse paws with his front
													feet, that action helps remove things from the hoof. The more things
													we keep natural the better it is for the horse.</p>

													<strong>Square Trim or Four Point Trim</strong>
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">There seems to be a lot talk about square trims or
													4-point.<br>
													<br>
													Foot trims like most things are constantly evolving and changing.
													Some changes prove to be good, others not so good. Seems like
													everyone is always trying to copy the natural wild horse hooves, but
													our domesticated horse are not wild.<br>
													<br>
													Wild horses travel up to 25 miles a day in search of food and water,
													they don"t sleep, stand and walk in their poop and urine or soaked
													footing in a stall. All these and other factors affect the hoof.<br>
													<br>
													It is my understanding that the trim called the square toe, square
													hoof or 4-point trim is duplicating the same principles. By squaring
													the toe, you create a faster break over and trying to make the hoof
													hit the ground more flat or heel first. A quicker break-over results
													in less stretching of the tendons, a change in the timing and path
													of the hooves" pattern, and in some cases changes the way the hoof
													wears and absorbs shock.<br>
													<br>
													This trim is sometimes used to help chronic founders, hock problems,
													interference problems. The basic aspects of this trim, if applied
													correctly, is said to help develop sole depth.<br>

													<h3><strong>My Advice for Basic Hoof Care</strong></h3>
													<p align="justify">If I had to tell someone in 50 words or less how
														to care for a horse"s hooves here is what I say and what I
														believe. Pick the feet daily, spray a bleach mix once a week,
														learn how to use a rasp (file) so you can do a light "mustang
														roll" once every two weeks on your horse"s feet, round off and
														smooth out chips and cracks until your Farrier or trimmer comes
														out, watch your Farrier trim your horse(s), learn what the hoof
														looks like before the trim and after the trim and ask questions
														from your Farrier. Be involved and study what your horse"s feet
														look like after their trim. If you trim yourself <u>"less is
															more."</u> Always trim less; you will not do damage or harm
														if you remove too little. You WILL do damage if you remove too
														much. My basic rules for hoof trimming are; the sole and hoof
														wall should be about the same level. I do not trim or remove
														sole unless I see a lump or uneven spot, otherwise I let the
														natural removal take place as the hoof flexes and is walked on.
														I roll the edges of the hoof wall to make it stronger and help
														prevent cracks and chips. I rasp the hoof once every two weeks
														to remove small amounts of growth, chips or flares. I take off
														the bars but I do not take them too low - about even with the
														sole but better a little higher than the sole then too low.
														Length of the hoof is not the main issue, level, balanced and
														hoof wall and sole as one is key for me.</p>
													<p align="justify"><strong><u>Some do"s and don"ts when it comes to
																Hoof Care / Maintenance:</u></strong></p>
													<p></p>
													<p></p>
													<p align="justify">Don"t over use conditioners and hoof dressings.
														Using these products too much interferes with the natural hoof
														development. It can make the hoof soft causing more damage,
														chipping and soreness. Don"t remove too much when filing with a
														rasp. Don"t use trimmers (nippers) this makes it too easy to
														remove too much hoof wall and if you are caring for the feet
														regularly, then you will not need nippers. A light rasping once
														a week or every two weeks will keep the hoof stable and will not
														create large changes in the hoof, like what happens when you
														just have your horse"s feet trimmed once every six or eight
														weeks. Keep a bleach mix (3/4 water - 1/4 bleach) in a spray
														bottle and spray in the hoof (frog area) after you pick the
														feet, about once every week or so. Do not do this everyday
														unless you smell a foul odor coming from the frog area when you
														pick the feet. If a foul odor is present, you can use this
														bleach every day but do not use it for over 4 or 5 days in a row
														since it will kill good bacteria if used too much or too often.
														<strong>And lastly, NO SHOES.</strong> Shoes are bad for horses,
														and transfer pounding and shock waves up the hoof, bones,
														tendons and legs. Shoes stop the natural movement and expansion
														of the hoof. In the picture below you can see the horse move
														naturally with <strong><u>NO SHOES.</u></strong> Nailing a
														non-movable metal shoe to a hoof stops and prevents this natural
														and needed movement. This movement is needed for blood flow and
														to keep a hoof healthy. Notice the hoof flexes many ways (front
														to back, side to side and flat), all stopped by shoes.</p>

													<p></p>
													<p align="justify"><strong>If you are switching to barefoot from
															shoes, give it time.</strong> The horse may be a little sore
														at first. Too many people want to say they tried barefoot and
														they took shoes off for one month and the horse was sore, so
														they went back to shoes. This is typical horse people wanting
														everything too fast and always in a hurry. It takes a hoof a
														full year to grow out. After years of putting nails and metal on
														the hoof and after all these years of screwing up the hoof,
														people want the hoof to adjust overnight to barefoot. "The slow
														way is the fast way;" give it time. There are many things to
														consider when going from shoes to barefoot.<br>
														<br>
														Things that could matter are time of year, type of ground, how
														the horse is kept (stall or pasture), how the horse is used or
														ridden, how bad the hooves are, how the Farrier took off shoes,
														how the Farrier trimmed the horse and many other factors. So
														don"t expect overnight results and plan to have a few problems
														for a year until the hoof has had time to adjust to a natural
														hoof. Another thing is, if your Farrier wants or tells you that
														your horse needs shoes, don"t have them trim your horse
														barefoot, they can make the horse lame and sore so they can be
														right and then tell you that "they told you so." Then they get
														to convince you that your horse needs shoes or has bad feet.
														<strong>Expect your horse to get sore and may limp a little;
															that is normal. If you break your leg and get your cast off,
															you will still limp.</strong> The hoof may get sore after a
														ride since the hoof has never supported your weight or his
														weight without shoes. This will strain the hoof at first until

													<strong><u>Things I Think are Important When Trimming Horse
															Hooves</u></strong> <u></u>
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">I thought I would do a list of top 10 things to watch
													for and then as I was thinking, there are other things to remember
													and look out for when trimming your horses. Therefore, here is my
													list of things that I think are important about trimming hooves.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Less is more:</strong> It is better to take
													off too little than too much. It is better to trim a little every
													week than once every 8 weeks. Doing less changes the hoof slower and
													does not shock the horse"s balance or hoof.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>The Hoof Wall:</strong> It is a capsule for
													the hoof. It holds many things together. Nails in the hoof
													compromises the hoof wall, which allows dirt and bacteria inside the
													hoof. The hoof wall protects the interior hoof, so making it thin or
													filing the sides weakens the hoof wall. The only part of the hoof
													wall that should be trimmed is the part that touches the ground. The
													hoof wall should not be shorter or higher than the sole.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Balanced and Level hoof:</strong> This is a
													guideline and not an absolute required perfection. The hoof wall
													should be about level with the sole, but should not be shorter. It
													is better to have a little long hoof wall past the sole than too
													short and have it higher and above the sole. Ideally, if the hoof
													wall is very slightly longer than sole then they will grow together
													and become tougher as one.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>The Sole:</strong> The sole is not weight
													bearing and is also weight bearing, depending on ground surface
													type. In sand pressure is on the sole and hoof wall. On hard
													surfaces or concrete, the hoof wall should be more weight bearing
													than the sole. On barefoot horses, the sole is used more than on
													shod horses. The sole is naturally shaved or foliated so it wears
													down with use. I only remove sole when it is uneven and gets bumps
													or protrusions that go past the hoof wall. If the sole is thick, the
													hoof wall has to be longer than sole. If the sole foliates then the
													hoof walls become longer than sole since the sole is now shorter or
													higher. A balanced approach is best. Keep the sole and hoof walls
													almost even with the sole a little shorter or with the hoof wall a
													little longer.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>The Bars:</strong> This again is said to be
													weight bearing and NOT weight bearing. If the bars are being pushed
													over and out then they are too long and are bearing too much weight.
													When dealing with bars, I think it is better to have them level with
													sole rather than longer or taller than sole. The rear of the bar
													helps determine the height of the heel.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>The Heel:</strong> Another area that some say
													high is better other say lower is better. I say not too long or not
													too short. Too short is touching or almost touching the bulb. Too
													long is making the horse walk on the toe too much. Balance is
													better, the sole determines the heel height. Longer than sole is
													better than shorter than sole. The bars and sole come back and
													balance with the heel. If the heel is too short, the hoof is not
													balanced and the horse walks on the heel instead of the entire hoof.
													If it is too long, then more weight is on the toe and the hoof is
													not carrying the load balanced.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>The frog:</strong> Some say trim short, some
													say do not trim. I think a little longer is better than too short.
													The frog wears down like the sole and the hoof wall. So it should
													not be shorter than the sole. Since the hoof flexes, it should touch
													or get pressure from the ground when the horse walks, but should not
													be lower than the hoof wall since that would cause too much
													pressure. So laying a rasp or straight stick across the hoof the
													rasp should touch both sides of the hoof wall but it should not
													touch the sole or the frog. If the frog touches the frog slightly
													with no pressure then that would be about prefect. That way when
													pressure from the horses weight is put on the hoof, then the frog
													will get slight pressure. The flexes is encouraged and assisted by
													pooling or scooping the quarters of the hoof wall.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Dealing with flares:</strong> Flares are
													caused by many things but normally by overgrowth of the hoof wall.
													If the hoof is trimmed every two weeks, flares will not happen since
													overgrowth is prevented. When a flare happens, it should be
													corrected from the bottom of the hoof wall and not so much from the
													side of the hoof wall. But if it is bad some slight shaving of the
													side wall may be needed. Flares unbalance the hoof, since one side
													gets more weight and pressure it causes the hoof wall to relieve
													that pressure by moving out or flaring. This also causes a
													separation of the hoof wall and sole, both weaken the hoof and put
													unbalanced pressure, which throws off balance and pressure so the
													horse"s weight is put on the quarter, toe or heel. This deforms the
													hoof as it grows. Prevention of flares is much better than
													correction of flares.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Dealing with Splits and Chips:</strong>
													Splits normally start as chips. They can also start from damage of
													the cornet band or damage to hoof wall. Chips on the bottom of the
													hoof wall can be managed and rounded to help prevent chips. When a
													chip happens it changes the balance of the hoof and transfers more
													pressure to other parts of the hoof. So by rounding and re-balancing
													the hoof slightly, you help prevent the chip from becoming a split.
													The more balanced the hoof the more the weight is distributed evenly
													so the less pressure points occur on the hoof. Again, a slight trim
													and rounding every two weeks keeps the hoof more balanced and even
													so minor things are corrected before they advance to more
													troublesome issues. More frequent trims also helps the hoof grow
													more evenly with even pressure and balanced growth, so that makes
													the hoof stronger. A stronger hoof supports weight more evenly,
													wears more evenly and functions better.</p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Scooping or Pooling Quarters:</strong> This
													is basically making the quarters a little shorter than the toe and
													heel. This is fine-tuning the hoof. By pooling or scooping the
													quarters, you allow a little spring or flexing action in the hoof
													whereby the toe and heel flatten out creating more movement in the
													hoof. This movement encourages sole growth and foliation, frog
													pressure and pumping action and increases blood flow to hoof. This
													is very easy to do too much, so remember less is more and better to
													have too little scoop than too much.</p>
												<p align="justify">If this does not make sense or you do not understand
													the terms I used, then YOU need to do more reading and studying so
													you know parts of the hoof. Working on a hoof is like horsemanship,
													it is a process and not an event.</p>
												<p></p>
												<hr>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify"><i>Side Note:</i> In an article I read, it states
													that "Studies showed that the impact force a shod hoof receives on
													hard ground is <strong>10-33 times that of an unshod hoof.</strong>
													The vibrations set up in the hoof by the vibration of the metal shoe
													is approximately 800 Hz, compared to "only" 150 Hz with a rubber
													shoe." That is just the horse, then add the weight of gear, people,
													running and jumping and people wonder we have so many lame horses.
													Those who know, understand that <strong>Horse Shoes Are Bad for
														Horses.</strong></p>

													<strong>Thrush, Whiteline Disease, Stinky Hoof - Care and
														Treatments</strong>
												</center><br>
												<br>
												I get many questions on Thrush, treatments and home remedies. I decided
												to do a section about it to have something to direct people to when they
												ask. So here is some information.<br>
												<br>
												<strong>DEFINITION:</strong><br>
												<br>
												Thrush has many names and is really a master of infection. It can be
												bacterial, Fungal, Yeast and or spores. Since Yeast feeds on dead
												bacteria, killing the bacteria feeds the yeast. Killing the thrush can
												kill good tissue and hoof so that is not good. Therefore, treating or
												killing this can be a viscous circle. Thrush is the equine equivalent of
												"athlete"s foot" of the hoof. Thrush is Anaerobic, meaning the bacteria
												does not do well in air. Which means it does really well in dark moist
												areas with little or no oxygen.<br>
												<br>
												<strong>PREVENTION:</strong><br>
												<br>
												Picking the feet often removes mud, feces and other infectious material
												that can contribute to thrush. Having a horse NOT locked in a stall
												where it has to stand in it"s urine and feces helps prevent it. Allowing
												horse to be free in pasture to move, walk and get exercise helps
												increase blood flow to hoof and they helps prevent thrush.<br>
												<br>
												<strong>TREATMENTS:</strong><br>
												<br>
												This is where it gets tricky. Every Farrier, Vet and horse owner has his
												or her opinion. I am going to list various treatments with some pros and
												cons. You can do your own research and make your own decision since each
												case of thrush can be different and each horse is different and in
												different environments. Most all treatments can include soaking the hoof
												and or packing the treatment into the hoof and deep into the frog
												area.<br>

													<strong>Four Pro-Barefoot Veterinarians Share Insights
														Below</strong>
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify"><strong>Luca Bein, Swiss Cavalry, University of
														Zurich, Switzerland Veterinary Medical Faculty
														Scientist.</strong> "In 1984, the Swiss Cavalry conducted
													research into the effect of metal shoeing. Studies showed that the
													impact force a shod hoof receives on hard ground is 10 to 33 times
													that of an unshod hoof. The vibration in the hoof from the shoe is
													approximately 800 hz. This level of vibration is high enough to
													destroy living tissue."<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Dr. Robert Cook, FRCVS, PhD, Professor of Surgery Emeritus
														at Tufts University.</strong> "All horses" hooves are healthier
													without shoes, and barefoot horses are healthier than shod horses.
													They live longer, happier, less painful lives. Barefoot is a
													requirement for health and should be accepted as a condition for
													keeping a horse. Humane management is not just preferable, it is
													nonnegotiable. The foot evolved to function unshod. Nature has
													developed the perfect design for grip and slide in all conditions
													and provided for unsurpassable shock absorption. The foot cannot
													expand and contract with each step when clamped. Blood supply to the
													foot is impoverished, and horn production becomes deficient. When
													the foot is prevented from functioning correctly, the pastern,
													fetlock, cannon, and knee are also placed at risk. This leads to
													bone, joint, and soft tissue injuries."<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Dr. Tomas Teskey, DVM.</strong> "Every horse that wears
													steel shoes suffers some degree of laminar separation. There are a
													myriad of other malfunctions that also occur in a shod hoof, and
													they all contribute to the hoof functioning in a completely
													different and abnormal fashion and it leads to a severe contraction
													in their size, so much so that when the shoe is removed the horses
													can no longer walk comfortably on their own feet. For the presence
													of steel on a horse"s feet, we are able to observe profound damages
													that occur due to the stagnation of blood within the hoof and the
													diminished return of blood back up toward the heart through the
													veins of the lower leg. Metal shoes interfere with the hoof"s
													natural blood-pumping mechanism. Period. I will never ask any client
													of mine to consider shoeing their horse with steel. I have
													conviction in my belief about this and it is unwavering. I feel that
													farriers and veterinarians and trainers and horse people must learn
													the truth about this and tell their clients, friends and colleagues
													that shoeing horses damages them and robs them of years of their
													lives."<br>
													<br>
													<strong>From The Unfettered Foot: A Paradigm Change for Equine
														Podiatry, Dr. Tomas G. Teskey, DVM. Dr. Robert Bowker,
														DVM.</strong> "The blood in horses" feet does much more than
													provide nutrients to hoof tissues. It also enables the unshod foot
													to function as a hydraulic system, in much the same way that
													gel-filled athletic shoes do. We need to be trimming hooves so that
													more of the back part of the foot-including the frog bears the
													initial ground impact forces and weight. Horseshoes provide a much
													smaller surface area to absorb shock. So if a bare hoof landing
													after a jump experiences, say, 1,000 pounds of loading per square
													foot, then with a traditional shoe, there"s going to be 2,000 pounds
													per square foot."<br>

													<strong>BETTER OFF BAREFOOT</strong>
												</center><br>
												<br>
												<i>The Natural Hoof Care Advantage - by Dr. Tomas G. Teskey D.V.M.
													Arizona, U.S.A.</i><br>
												<br>
												Ask your veterinarian, farrier or trainer about hoof care and the
												majority will freely admit that all equines are most healthy if they can
												be kept without steel shoes. Some believe, however, that shoeing is a
												necessary evil, evidently important for today"s working horses, mules
												and donkeys. Veterinary medicine has its roots in blacksmithing,
												branching directly from the iron-working profession. The two developed
												into their own specialties, but the hooves continued to be the
												"territory" of the iron men. With the ever-increasing knowledge of the
												hoof, farriery and veterinary medicine struggle for understanding and
												reason after a thousand years of tradition. As time marches on, a new
												paradigm for hoof care that does no harm is replacing methods that
												misunderstand the hoof. Given the latest exciting hoof research, the
												finest in hoof care today is focusing on maintaining normal hoof form
												and function to achieve optimum health:<br>
												<br>
												- ensuring the hoof can flex in all directions to handle the terrain<br>
												<br>
												- promoting fluid movement and circulation<br>
												<br>
												- protecting sensitive structures inside the feet and legs<br>
												<br>
												- wearing evenly through movement and growing in evenly and strong<br>
												<br>
												- helping engage and sense the environment<br>
												<br>
												These are all achievable with natural hoof care and impossible using
												steel shoes or improper trimming. In fact, placing shoes on hooves fixes
												them in two dimensions, forcing the joints above to twist and torque
												arthritic changes such as ringbone result. Normally shaped, healthy
												hooves are made of a specialized skin that can be conditioned to handle
												any terrain, flexing the proper amount to prevent damage to all joints
												in the body.<br>
												<br>
												Shoes disrupt normal energy and circulation patterns body-wide, forcing
												the heart to work harder, stagnating energy flow and causing abnormal
												hoof growth. Healthy hooves pump large amounts of blood to keep
												themselves strong and all body systems vital and energized.<br>
												<br>
												Instead of protecting the hooves, shoes cause concussive damage, promote
												weak growth and allow infection, heat and cold to invade the hooves,
												causing health problems for the entire body. Normal hooves are perfectly
												protective, insulate against temperature extremes and prevent injury
												from rough terrain.<br>
												<br>
												Hooves can"t wear themselves when shod without a little bit of normal
												wear, they become deformed and infected with fungus and bacteria.
												Exfoliation keeps hooves healthy and free from infection and stimulates
												strong, new growth.<br>
												<br>
												Shoes prevent the horse from sensing the earth and their own hooves,
												stumbling, loss of traction and increased injuries result when shod. The
												loss of a shoe and the lameness that follows demonstrates the underlying
												unsoundness of the shod horse. If shod horses suffer no ill effects from
												their shoes, as many professionals contend, why are they so lame within
												minutes when walking a short distance without them? Soundness in horses
												has come to mean moving with animation and impulsion on unfettered feet.
												These horses appreciate normal sensation and feel comfortable around us,
												place their feet accurately, with superior soundness and traction,
												keeping themselves and their riders safer. When in need of protection on
												rough terrain or during rehabilitation, flexible, removable boots that
												complement hoof form and function are most appropriate, providing
												superior protection and doing no harm to the horse.<br>
												<br>
												Just as it was a change in horsemanship practices that allowed horses"
												health to deteriorate, so a change in horsemanship is required for them
												to regain their vitality achieving peak performance takes more than just
												trimming hooves a certain way. Proper nutrition and lifestyle are
												critical for success. Natural horsemanship practices today go hand in
												hand with natural hoof care together they are unbeatable! These horses
												and their astute caregivers are leading the way in all parts of the
												equine industry, demonstrating the efficiency of the natural hoof care
												paradigm which raises horses with superior hooves and prevents all
												common hoof diseases. These are the priceless advantages that are
												bringing horses and their owners greater enjoyment all over the
												world.<br>

													<strong>METAL, MYTH & EQUINE MISERY<br>
														<br></strong> PRIMUM NON NOCERE (First, do no harm) -
													Hippocrates (c. 460-377 BC<br>
													<br>
													When we talk of horses the word "technology" does not immediately
													spring to mind. Yet there are two technologies that have been
													intimately associated with the horse for so long that we overlook
													their invidious nature and accept them without question: the bit and
													the horseshoe. The good news is that harmless alternatives to both
													technologies have now been developed, tested and widely practiced.
													The bit can be replaced with a cross under design of bitless
													bridle1, 2 and with simple management changes a horse can go
													barefoot.3-5<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Two big myths<br>
														<br>
														Invention of the bit facilitated the domestication of the horse,
														six thousand years ago.</strong> Early bits were probably made
													out of plaited vines, followed by wood, antlers and bone. Metal bits
													of the Bronze Age were the forerunners of today"s stainless steel
													bits. The most ancient of bits are instantly recognizable for what
													they are and we don"t need an archeologist"s interpretation. The
													principle and mode of action is unaltered. One or more metal rods
													are inserted into a horse"s mouth and held in place by means of a
													bridle. A rein attached to each side of the bit is manipulated by
													the driver or rider (Fig.1). <strong>To this day, most horsemen
														believe that a bit controls a horse when, in reality, the bit is
														the most common cause of complete loss of control. Though horses
														have been bolting, bucking and rearing their way through
														history, this "control" myth survives all evidence to the
														contrary.</strong><br>

													set of reins attached to the bottom ring permit pressure from the

													<strong>The horseshoe is a medieval invention. It was in common use
														by 900 AD and is proudly depicted in the 11th century Bayeux
														tapestry on the fettered feet of William"s horses. Again, over
														the ensuing millennium, neither the design nor the principle has
														changed.</strong> A metal hoop is applied to the solar surface
													of the hoof and fixed in position by a series of nails driven
													through its wall (Fig.2). Today, most horsemen still believe that
													the purpose of the horseshoe is to protect the hoof. But evidence
													gathered in the last 25 years shows this to be incorrect.9-11 In
													fact, shoes cause serious harm to the hooves and ultimately to the
													whole horse.12 Properly managed (i.e. neither stabled nor shod) a
													horse can be used for all the extraordinary purposes that man
													expects of his "best friend", including hundred mile endurance races
													over rocky terrain. There is only one exception. Specially designed
													shoes are still necessary for Western style reining competitions,
													where (highly unnatural) sliding stops are a required part of a
													performance. <strong>Yet the "protection" myth lives on in all other
														disciplines.<br>

													it should be for proper weight distribution. Increased stress is
													placed on the sensitive laminae of the wall. This 19 year-old horse
													had severe laminitis with rotation of the third phalanx and
													penetration of its tip through the sole. Barefoot management
													restored the horse to health. Photo Claudia Garner<br>

													Persistence of old ideas<br>
													<br>
													As John Maynard Keynes wrote, "<strong>The difficulty lies not in
														the new ideas, but in escaping the old ones, which ramify, for
														those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of
														our minds, like the clinging roots of an old
														juniper."</strong><br>
													<br>
													Several factors account for a horse still being in irons:<br>
													<br>
													There are not many technologies in use today that are unchanged
													since the Bronze Age (bitting) or Saxon times (shoeing),
													nevertheless, "undiscovered crime" is undoubtedly a factor.
													<strong>It was not until the end of the last millennium that the
														many harmful effects of bitting and shoeing were fully
														recognized</strong><br>
													<br>
													In the absence of an acceptable alternative, bitting and shoeing
													have been justified as necessary evils. As far as bitting is
													concerned, it has long been a fundamental assumption on the part of
													English style riders (though not Western) that there is no
													alternative to a bit. Similarly, shoes have been regarded as
													indispensable for serious riding or driving. By definition, as it
													were, a stabled horse must be shod. <strong>It has not been
														recognized that stabling in the first instance results in the
														poor hoof quality that now "requires" shoeing to "protect" the
														hoof.</strong> Tradition and custom is a potent cause for the
													persistence of a practice. Horsemen are conservative by nature and
													tradition alone has become a reason for resisting change.
													<strong>But tradition is not a sufficient reason for maintaining a
														practice when new knowledge shows that tradition is not
														consistent with good welfare, i.e. the physiological needs of
														the horse.</strong><br>
													<br>
													There is always a time lag between research being completed and
													results being applied. Passage of a whole generation has not been
													uncommon. <strong>In this age of information, one might hope that
														such a time lag would not occur over matters concerning equine
														welfare.</strong> Unfortunately committees make rules and
													regulations and such bodies are vulnerable to what social scientists
													call a cascade and the problem of mistaken consensus. If one person
													on a committee "gets it wrong" and is confident enough in his
													rejection of a new idea, he "infects" others and there follows a
													cascade of misinformation. <strong><u>But science is not a democracy
															and the acceptance of scientific advances should be decided
															on the evidence and not on a majority vote influenced by
															crowd behavior.</u></strong><u></u><br>
													<br>
													Finally, there is the "not in my back yard" problem. The
													introduction of a new idea brings with it an element of the unknown
													and unfamiliar and this, in turn, raises the spectre of litigation.
													Administrative bodies are inclined<br>
													<br>
													"In England we have come to rely upon a comfortable time lag of
													fifty years or a century intervening between the perception that
													something ought to be done and a serious attempt to do it."- Herbert
													George Wells 1866-1946 , to wait until some other organization has
													taken the first plunge. Individuals, on the other hand, are more
													open to new ideas. It is heartening to witness the enthusiasm with
													which many thousands of riders and drivers have already adopted the
													bitless &/or barefoot way and are showing by example.<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Equine Misery<br>
														<br></strong> Rose Macaulay wrote, <strong><u>"Behaviour of such
															cunning cruelty, that only a human being could have thought
															of or contrived, we call "inhumane", revealing thus some
															pathetic ideal standard for our species that survives all
															betrayals."</u></strong> <u></u><br>
													<br>
													The British Veterinary Association"s Ethics and Welfare Group
													updated the working definition of "animal welfare" recently as
													relating "to both the physical and mental wellbeing of the animal."
													The inclusion of mental wellbeing is especially relevant to the
													horse, a prey animal that for its evolutionary survival - is
													dependent upon being easily frightened. <strong>My own research has
														revealed the high degree to which the pain of a bit frightens a
														horse. It triggers flight, fight and freeze responses that, in
														man"s environment, are dangerous to both horse and rider. Simply
														from the point of human safety it is not a good idea to frighten
														an animal as powerful as a horse. Apart from the fact that a
														rider loses control of a frightened horse, it is
														inhumane.</strong> The oral cavity is one of the most sensitive
													parts of a horse"s anatomy. It is inhumane to place a metal rod in a
													sensitive body cavity and apply pressure. "To rule with a rod of
													iron" (or try to) is to rule tyrannically. Interestingly, the
													manipulation of an instrument (a bit) in a body cavity (the mouth)
													could be considered an act of invasive surgery. The word "surgery"
													derives from a Greek word that means, literally, "a working with the
													hands." If the bit had never been invented and some scientist today
													submitted a research grant proposal that involved such "surgery" on
													a conscious horse, the proposal would be hastily rejected by any
													reviewing board.<br>
													<br>
													As Noel Coward didn"t say, <strong>the bit has a talent to abuse. It
														is responsible for over 100 examples of negative behaviour, most
														of which are triggered by pain and fear and some of which are
														fatal to man and horse.8 If a medication had half as many
														serious side-effects it would be withdrawn from the
														market.</strong> Apart from what might be described as the
													"scared horse syndrome" the bit causes over 40 different diseases.7
													Physical health is certainly affected as well as mental health (Fig
													3). A number of the bit-induced diseases were previously categorized
													as idiopathic, such as dorsal displacement of the soft palate,
													epiglottal entrapment and asphyxia-induced pulmonary oedema
													("bleeding" in racehorses).<br>
													<br>
													Fig. 4. Showing some of the physical trauma to the jaw and teeth
													caused by a bit. 1 = bone spurs on the bars of the mouth; 2 =
													erosion of the first three cheek teeth from constant bit pressure
													and a horse trying to defend itself by "grabbing the bit"; 3 =
													shedding of the first cheek tooth; 4 = periostitis of the empty
													alveolus. Compare with the normal jaw above Robert Cook The misery
													caused by shoeing is obvious in different ways but just as serious.
													Whereas some of the harmful effects of bitting become apparent even
													on day one after removing the bit, the improvement in welfare after
													removing the shoes takes time to become apparent. Whereas the bit"s
													effects are acute in nature, the shoe"s effects are chronic.12
													Shoeing acts like a slow poison. Its effects are cumulative and it
													may be years before a serious problem surfaces, such as navicular
													disease or laminitis. The delayed action of shoeing has sheltered it
													from being discovered as the true cause of these two common
													scourges. Sadly, because deformity of the hoof by this time is
													advanced, it can take months or even years before normality can be
													restored by a barefoot management program (Fig 8). The clinical
													signs that result from traditional management (i.e. stabling and
													shoeing) include intermittent or persistent lameness, poor hoof
													quality, sand cracks, seedy toe, solar bruising, contracted heels,
													and reduced shock absorption leading to ossification of the lateral
													cartilages and stress on joints and ligaments. Inability of the hoof
													to fully dilate and contract with intermittent loading impairs
													circulation to the foot. It also impairs systemic circulation as
													healthy hooves act like four supplementary cardiovascular pumps,
													something that is especially necessary at fast exercise. As with the
													bit, a clinical sign easily overlooked is inability to carry out the
													work required and premature death.<br>

													phalanx. Compare the shape of the normal third phalanx in the

													<strong>Relief of Misery<br>
														<br></strong> Replacement of the bit with the crossunder bitless
													bridle provides painless and more effective rider/horse
													communication for all disciplines, and for all types, breeds and age
													of horse (Fig 6).2 The method is usable by riders of all ages and
													experience from novice to professional. It enhances a rider"s skills
													as it encourages the use of seat and legs rather than hands.<br>
													<br>
													Fig. 6: Showing a caudo-lateral and ventral view of the crossunder
													bitless bridle. A squeeze of the right rein (yellow arrow) nudges
													the entire left side of the head (red arrows), painlessly signaling
													"steer to the right." An intermittent squeeze on both reins hugs the
													whole head, signalling "slow" or "stop."<br>

													Hall/Hughes Photography Removal of shoes and the institution of a
													barefoot management program (24/7 turnout and trimming as required
													when overgrowth occurs) enable a horse to be ridden over all
													terrains from rock to sand and under all conditions, including ice
													and snow. Barefoot horses perform to advantage in all disciplines.3

													<br>
													<strong>Impediments to Relief<br>
														<br></strong> There are no contraindications to bitless or
													barefoot management from equine health or the equestrian"s point of
													view. The only impediments are of an administrative nature. For
													example, the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) currently
													mandates the use of one or more bits for the discipline of dressage
													and for the dressage phases of other disciplines. This brings about
													the bizarre situation whereby a bit is required for dressage but not
													for the more dangerous cross-country and show jumping phases of
													eventing. National federations follow the FEI lead. The FEI
													influence even cascades down to Pony Club level, so children with
													less than perfect hands are obliged to use instruments of torture.
													As a result, their ponies become "hot" and difficult to handle. The
													stewards of racing currently require a horse to be raced with a
													bit.<br>
													<br>
													There are fewer administrative rules that require shoes for
													competitions. But sadly an impediment to the freer adoption of
													barefoot management programs comes from farriers and our own
													profession. At present, relatively few veterinarians and farriers
													have studied the barefoot research. So owners are unable to look to
													these professionals for help in transitioning their horses from shod
													to barefoot. This will change in time.<br>
													<br>
													<strong>Conclusions<br>
														<br></strong> <strong>The horse cannot be "supplemented" with
														steel rods in its mouth and steel hoops on its feet without
														interfering with its physiological efficiency. It is as though
														one takes a computer and expects it to work after you have
														driven a couple of iron stakes through its casing. We
														"supplement" the horse at our peril. Bits and shoes are weapons
														of horse destruction. Bitless and barefoot management represents
														state-of-the-art non-technology.</strong><br>
													<br>
													<strong>Cruelty has been usefully defined by David Morton as the
														infliction of avoidable pain and suffering. Now that
														physiologically compatible alternatives are available to the
														pain and suffering inflicted by bits and shoes, both of these
														primitive technologies are now avoidable.</strong> Being
													avoidable, their classification undergoes a sea change. By
													definition, bitting and shoeing are now cruel practices.14 It is to
													be hoped that the administrative bodies of horse sports worldwide
													will quickly update their rules to bring them into line with these
													two historic advances in equine welfare.<br>
