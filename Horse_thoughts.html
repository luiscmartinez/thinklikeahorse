											<strong><u>The Story of an Oak Tree and a Willow Tree:</u></strong>
											<center>
												<strong></strong>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">In life's travels you can choose to be an a
													strong mighty Oak Tree that is hard, inflexible and will not
													bend or You can also choose to be a flimsy flowing Willow
													Tree that is not rigid at all, it bends and flows in the
													wind so it is not snapped off or up-rooted. The Oak can be
													compared to a strong willed person that is solid, or a proud
													strong horse, the Oak means what he says and stands where it
													stands without changing places just to be popular or
													flexible, sticking to your guns, so to speak. The Willow can
													be compared to a wise person who avoids all conflict, or a
													horse that has been broken and has his sole stolen, they
													never really takes a stand, will go with the flow, will not
													take a position and move with whatever way the wind is
													blowing. Neither way is best all the time. A combination of
													the two works well in life and with horses. Knowing when to
													be which one is the hard part.</p>
												<p align="justify">There are times you should be an Oak, do not
													bend, do not compromise and do not allow the horse any slack
													until he knows you are the leader. In addition, there are
													times when you need to be a flexible and allow yourself to
													bend and change your focus and allow the horse some slack to
													try to make a mistake to earn his trust and show him you can
													be a good leader. The big challenge is knowing when to be
													the Oak and when to be the Willow. No right answer here, no
													book, no checklist, no video, just experience, knowledge,
													hard lessons and sometime, just good luck.</p>
												<p align="justify">If more people thought about this, maybe the
													next time they catch themselves being a strong mighty Oak,
													they would evaluate the situation, look at it from the
													horse's point of view and maybe think it may be a good time
													to change and become a flexible Willow. Maybe cut the horse
													some slack, let the pressure situation calm down, and let
													the rough winds blow by and give yourself and the horse some
													time to relax, so the horse can become a Willow as well.

												<p align="justify">I get many questions about <u>fear</u>. Every
													horse person wants to know how to get fast results with
													little or no effort and they will not take no for an answer.
													In fact, many will spend 10 years or more looking for
													shortcuts rather than investing a year or two in good
													learning and education. The following statement is what
													interferes with people and prevents progress with horses.
													Fast never works out good for the horse, the slow way is the
													fast way.</p>

													prepares, cooks and serves good food.<br>
													<br>
													When people that do not understand horses see a good horse,
													they see the saddle, the bit, or the breed. They do not
													understand that none of that matters, it is how the horse is

												<p align="justify">You will hear it after every barn, "My horse
													is scared of water". This is one of those ridiculous
													statements that make no sense. Horses are not scared of
													water. Horses can be taught to be scared of water by
													insecure owners, or by being protected from water, or by
													being locked up in stalls so they do not know about water,
													or if they were imprinted by humans that are afraid to let
													their horses in water. Horses are NOT scared of water!</p>

												<p align="justify">I can always tell how comfortable someone is
													with a horse by the way they lead a horse or take a picture
													with a horse. Look at most horse pictures of horses and
													people, you will see the handler/owner hanging on the lead
													rope or chain and making the horse keep his head looking at
													the camera. Taking pictures with you holding a lead rope or
													snap or chain so you can get your horse to stand still shows
													a lack of horsemanship and lack of understand. You should be
													able to get your horse's head where you want it - without a
													rope or a chain - <strong>by using feel and
														communication.</strong></p>

												<hr>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify">There is a book by Pony boy and in it, I was
													told, he makes the statement: "Horses move men physically
													and they move women emotionally". I think he states his book
													is to women for women. Funny women love this stereotype
													since it sounds pleasant, loving and sweet. However, if I
													point out negative stereotypes and they do not like it, I am
													called a sexist. I guess it is all what you want to see and
													hear. One thing is for sure, if you want women to buy your
													stuff, make it in pink and make it sound nice and lovey
													dovey, you may be an idiot and not know a damn thing about
													what you are selling or what you teaching, but you will sell
													a lot of product. Too bad women cannot see people that play
													to their sense of color and words may be worse for them than
													someone who does not sweet talk or BS them. <strong>I think
														it is better if someone tells you what you need to hear,

												<p align="justify">Find a Horseman and <u>NOT</u> a trainer.
													<strong>Do you know the difference?</strong> Trainers may
													say they have accreditation, awards, certificates, dress the
													part and will tell you they know many great well-known
													horsemen and studied from the best, but what really counts
													is how they handle a horse. What is a good process on how to
													find a good trainer? Too many variables. How do you know if
													he knows or what do you look for? You don't go by what
													others say since they may not know the difference anymore
													than you do. Does s/he get results, style, you do not know
													what too aggressive is or what too nice is. There is No pass
													or fail test, no professional standards in horse training,
													no oversight or review of methods, no safety records, no
													certification process, no license or stamp of approval,
													nothing, just word of mouth and BS words coming from mouths.
													What is a professional? By definition, anyone paid money for
													a job is considered a professional? Really, so if one dummy
													can find another dummy to pay them, they are a professional
													horse trainer. If you do not know the difference from a
													Horseman and horse trainer, then you are cannot effectively

													at all of them. One mind on one thing will give you a better
													chance at success. Yet in horses, I see too many minds in
													new people. They <strong>"try"</strong> and focus on others,
													on clinics they attended, on what they read, on what someone
													told them, on what their trainer is saying, on who is
													watching, on what others are thinking and many other things.
													Too many minds on too many things. One mind on one thing -
													<strong>"The horse".</strong> That is the first step to

												<p align="justify">Horsemanship is a strange art. It takes

													advice and information out there. Some is valid and
													accurate, most is BS and used to make you scared or confuse
													you, some is to make you think horsemanship is too difficult
													for you to know so you need someone else to teach you.
													<i>How do you know the difference?</i> With horses you start
													with consistency to make something routine and to teach the
													horse a habit. Then after you build the horse up and give
													him confidence, you then break up into small steps and
													change things. Remember, <strong>prior learning makes later
														learning easier.</strong> Once a horse learns to learn,
													then learning becomes easier. When you get a horse
													comfortable with change, he expects change and change
													becomes routine. Therefore, habits can be modified or
													changed and the horse expects it and accepts it.

													You will not see a Mare rear like this too often. Normally
													this behavior is reserved for Geldings or Stallions. This is
													the way boys play, they get rough, they try to learn to be
													dominate. They practice getting strong, learning fighting
													skills and looking big, that way when this is needed later
													in life they will be prepared. This behavior can be used to
													fight off rivals, to scare off predators and to fight for
													their life. People who react this behavior with fear,
													screams and think they have to save a horse from this, do
													not understand what it is to be a horse. A Horse knows how
													to be a horse and the Horse is the best teacher of the

													think a horse is doing something to YOU, then you make it
													personal and emotional, both are bad when working with
													horses. But Rick, remember what Ponyboy said, "girls are
													emotional". He said it in his book for you women; I did not
													say it, so save the hate mail. If you try to make horses
													emotional, you will confuse the horse and teach bad lessons.
													They are a horse and that is all they know how to be. Ego,

													trying to tell and confuse the horse even more. This never

													the horse to react more, become more fearful and trapped,

											harmful thing I see done to horses. People want a trusting
											relationship with their horse and then want to be scared of being
											close to their horse. <strong>This is a foolish theory;</strong>
											this is a thing being sold as safety. It promotes fear and is bad
											for the horse and horsemanship. I wish more people would hear and
											learn this message. Every time you push your horse away or out of
											your space you show fear, insecurity and tell your horse you do not
											trust them and do not feel safe or comfortable close to them. I am
											working on a page about fear, where I will address this topic in
											more detail. A horse knows if you trust him and knows if you fear
											him. A horse does not know how to be safely in your space if he is
											never allowed to be there?</p>

										<p align="justify">Horse training and horsemanship should always be

											many still use them and neither are needed and both show a lack of
											abilities in your horsemanship. <i><strong>It is like looking for a
													black cat in a dark room, it is not easy to find, especially
													if you believe there is no cat.</strong></i>
											<strong></strong> Admitting that there is better ways for the horse
											is the first step, too many in the horse world want to defend what
											they do, since it is all that they know. When you question someone's
											belief system, expect a strong and often angry resistance. Stupid
											humans hate being told they are wrong.

											many reasons. When people think they know more about a horse than a
											horse, that is normally big trouble. The Horse is best teacher of
											the horse. When people try and remove babies from their mom they
											screw up horses and make horses suffer. I say it all the time,
											<strong>"Leave a foal with mom, period."</strong> However, there are
											still all these know nothing horse people that push Human
											Imprinting. Imprinting a horse is a cheat, it is a short cut and a
											way for people to try and rush a relationship with a new born horse.
											IT NEVER WORKS OUT WELL. You will have no problem finding people
											that swear it made their horse perfect and lovable. When someone
											tells you how great imprinting is, ask him or her if they sent their
											horse to a trainer? Imprinting by humans miss valuable lessons a
											horse needs to learn and these lessons cannot be taught by a human.
											The above picture is a prefect example. The horse is NOT being bad
											or mean or disrespectful, however if this baby tired this with a
											human, it would be corrected, confused or taught that it can do this
											to humans and later in life it would hurt a human. <strong>Humans
												cannot teach a horse better than a horse. Anyone that tells you

												target="_blank"><u><strong>The Napoleon
														Complex</strong></u><strong></strong>.</a> is another
											thing I see around horses. Many people tend to want to prove
											something with horses. Since the horse is so strong, secure,
											peaceful and powerful, somehow controlling a horse gives people's
											ego a boost. Too often, it becomes more about proving you are right,
											rather than having a good and loving relationship with your horse.
											Do not be a "right-fighter" with your horse. It is not about you, it
											is about the horse. First, you are probably not right in the horse
											world and second, if you make a horse show you that he is stronger
											and if you make him fight, he will, you may not like the results.

												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"
												target="_blank"><u><strong>yin and yang (also Ying &
														Yang)</strong></u><strong></strong>.</a> , an old
											Chinese example of how things work. The outer circle is everything
											and the back and white are opposites, both colors are energy or
											force and they both need each other to become whole and balanced. So
											you can have positive and negative or good and bad, but it
											illustrates an important message in the harmony of life and horses.
											In this picture if you look closely you will notice two horse heads.
											The point to get from this is in all good there is some bad and in
											all bad there is some good. Balance in all things makes it whole.
											Just has no one should only be judged by their worst deed, a horse
											should never be judged by his past or his worst moments. All things
											need from other things, like a child needs a dad and mom, both give
											different things in different things in different ways. Horses need
											a mom and lead stallion to pass on things that they both have.<br>
											<br>
											Time and time again, in species where the males and females are
											separated the young develop behavior issues. Keeping horses isolated
											and alone or boxed in stalls/cells is bad for their development. A
											horse needs horses, young, old, male and female. Horses need horses
											to teach them how to be horses. <strong>People CANNOT teach a horse
												how to be a horse</strong><br>
											<br>
											In your horsemanship if you look at you and the horse as yin and
											yang, you will know and understand how both are fluid and feed off
											each other. Both can make the other one better or worse. Both have
											good and bad and when put together you become one, being more
											balanced and whole. Seeing a horse as part of you and you as part of
											the horse will help you develop more feel and will help develop your
											rhythm and timing. You will be able to notice how you affect the
											horse and how the horse affects you. Both, you and the horse, can
											either help the other or hurt the other. The decision is yours. A
											horse is not your slave a horse should be your partner = part of
											you. Meet the horse - Meet the person / A horse is only a reflection
											of the person / Fear promotes fear / You get what you give.

											and needed to understand them in order to get maximum benefit from
											them. Since horses were so common, it was the opposite of now, it
											was really hard to find someone that did not know anything about a
											horse. When horses lost their use, value and benefit - horsemanship

											need to invest in a trailer yet. They probable cannot afford a

											experience, the people without trailers are the same people that do
											not provide good care to their horses. Not getting things like
											worming medicine, shots, quality hay and other things, and they are
											always looking to borrow a trailer when they need it. This is not

											to depend on others for care of your horse, you put your horse in a
											position to depend on others for its care.</p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>Never lend your horse trailer out.</strong>
											This is one of those lessons that normally has to be learned the
											hard way since most people want to help and be nice. I have seen
											time and time again when trailers are borrowed they are broke.
											People that do not own trailers do not normally pull trailers, so
											the odds of them messing up or having an accident are high. Things
											like cutting short on a turn can pinch a tire and weaken the
											sidewall so it may not go flat now but can blow out later. Hitting a
											curb can bend an axle or cause misalignment with will make your
											tires wear bad and will make the ride rougher. Many things to go
											wrong and I assure you if the people do not own a trailer and are
											borrow yours, you can bet they will not buy you a new trailer if
											they wreck yours and will not have the money to fix yours.
											<i>"Neither a borrower or a lender"</i> is very wise advice with
											most things and especially with horse people.

											<strong>Listening to the Horse</strong>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Of all the things I have done wrong over the years,
											it was this that was the hardest to learn. As predators, we are in
											control, always teaching, training, correcting, telling and
											believing we know best. I still catch myself not listening to my
											horse now and then. This has to be worked at constantly and must not
											be forgotten. The horse tells us so much about so many things, but
											as stupid humans, we are always too busy, too smart and too stupid
											to step back, look and listen to our horse. This is such a critical
											error in horsemanship. A horse will tell you to slow down, that he
											is confused, that he is trying, that he is not understanding, that
											he needs help, that he is not ready and many other things,
											<i><strong>if only the stupid human would slow down and take the
													time to listen.</strong></i><strong></strong>

											inabilities to be successful with the horse. It is the Horseman that

										<h3><strong>Doing the Opposite of What Seems Normal</strong></h3>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>I often say this a lot in Horsemanship -
												doing the opposite of what you think is right. Our training,
												life experiences, knowledge, understanding and learned skills
												may tell us to do things a certain way. These things can be
												right sometime and may be wrong sometime. Others may see what we
												are doing as odd or not making sense. Since we are predators and
												a horse is prey, we are opposite in many ways, so some time
												doing the opposite of we think is right, works out better for
												the horse.</strong></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>We recently had some fires in my area and it
												reminded me of a story. Two men found themselves trapped on a
												hillside and surrounding by a raging fire rapidly catching up
												with them. They were running and running but the fire was
												gaining on them and it looked as if they were not going to make
												it and would be burned alive. The older of two suddenly stopped
												running, pulled out his lighter, knelled down and started
												lighting the grass on fire. The younger of the two could not
												understand what this guy was doing and left him and kept
												running. The older guy lived and younger guy died? Why? You see
												if you had any fire training and were older and wiser, you would
												know that when a fire is coming it needs fuel to burn. By
												lighting the grass around him he burnt up the fuel and gave
												himself a place to lay down, that was already burnt, with no
												fuel, so when the fire caught up to him, it would not have fuel
												and would burn the fuel around him and pass over him. This is
												what happened in this case. The man lay down and covered up with
												a fire blanket over the burnt area with no fuel and the fire
												passed him. His younger friend was not so lucky, he was over
												come by exhaustion, fell in the grass, in the fuel and the fire
												burnt him and the fuel he laid on.</strong></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>So from the outside many would say only a
												fool would stop and light a fire when running from and trying to
												escape a wild fire. When in fact, doing the opposite of what
												seemed dumb, is what saved his life.</strong></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>In many areas with horses, when you, as a
												predator, think you should pull, you should actually release.
												When you think you should rush over and help, you should stay
												out of it and not interfere or add pressure to the horse. When
												your instinct tells you to pull on the reins to try and stop a
												running horse, you should actually relax the reins and just
												ride. When your emotion tells you that your poor horse has been
												abused and you think you should be extra nice, you should
												actually be extra clear and strong with your leadership. When a
												horse pulls or rears and your instinct is to pull back, you
												should actually not pull and move to horse's butt. When a horse
												tries to run off you will want to grab the rope tighter and
												think you can stop him, which will get you a nice deep rub burn.
												An experienced horseman will not squeeze the rope and will let
												it run through his hands, knowing he cannot stop the horse by
												grabbing tighter. Many things in horses is learning NOT to
												follow your predator instinctive reactions and to know how and
												what the horse is seeing and feeling and to react like a higher
												horse would and NOT like a human predator would.</strong></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>Learning this can take many years, time,
												effort and listening to many horses. It is easy to see when
												someone knows this since the horse appears to understand,
												connect, and cooperate with the handler. Of course many will see
												this understanding and communication as a gift or special sense
												or some secret horse whisperer wisdom, when in fact it is
												nothing more that someone who understands horses and has trained
												his reactions to work with and understand the horse with timing
												and feel, rather than to blame the horse for his
												failures.</strong></p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>So when you see someone making a mistake with
												a horse, think, what would have happened if the person had done
												the opposite of what they did? If you take care of and learn
												your horsemanship, your horsemanship will take care of you and
												your horse. When you get better Your horse gets better.</strong>

											<strong><u><strong>Let's discuss FEAR:</strong></u></strong>
										</center><strong><u></u></strong><u><br>
											<br></u>
										<p align="justify">This is perhaps the biggest inhibitor to human and
											horse relationship. Both feel fear, both know fear, both react to
											fear but both fears are very different. A human is scared to be out
											of control, scared to get hurt or scared of what might happen, or
											what will hurt them. This is nowhere near the high-level fear of
											what a horse feels. A horse's fear is about life or death. A horse
											wants to live and all their fear is to survive. This is why their
											response to fear is much stronger than humans are. A horse is born
											to live, survive, and run. They do not care about what might happen,
											they don't care if they may get hurt, they instinctively run from
											fear to stay alive.</p>
										<p align="justify"> So when humans react to fear with aggression or
											retreat or confusion or frustration, the horse only reacts to fear
											to flee and stay alive. This is so misunderstood and it creates so
											many problems for most horse people. It amazes me that people want
											and expect a horse to deal and control their fear of dying, yet most
											humans cannot control their fear of getting hurt. Unfair and
											unreasonable, but only the human has choices, the horse never gets a
											choice. They are stuck with the person they are with and they have
											no choice for any situation they are forced into by a scared or
											unknowing human.</p>
										<p align="justify"><u></u></p>
										<center>
											<u><strong>A fish does not know he is wet, just a like a horse does
													not know he is safe, is the absence of fear the same as
													safety?</strong></u>
										</center><u><strong></strong><br>
											<br></u>
										<p align="justify">Cut your horse some slack. They get scared, they
											react, they want to stay alive, (stupid horse) until you can control
											your fear 100 percent, do not expect or ask your horse to do it.
											Stop and think like a horse, stop and see things from a horse's
											perspective not a human perspective. Understand what strong
											instinctual forces drive the horse's fear and help him work through
											it, learn to control it and don't contribute to it or make it worse.
											<strong>The best gift you can give to your horse is understanding of
												the horse.</strong>
										</p>
										<p align="justify">The next time you get upset or frustrated with your
											horse's fear, just think if your horse treated you the same you
											treat him when you get scared. You get what you give, would you like
											your horse to cause pain, pull your hair, pull on a pain bit, hit
											you or scream at you every time you got scared. I doubt it. If you
											understand the horse then you can treat the horse the way you would
											want to be treated, if you were a horse.</p><u></u>
										<hr>
										<p align="justify"><u></u></p>
										<center>
											<u><strong>How does a horse show FEAR?</strong></u>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Let me count the ways. A horse shows fear is so many
											ways, some very subtle and some not so subtle or a combination of
											both.</p>
										<p align="justify">Horse fear = ear position, head position, head high,
											tense body, bracing, balking, stalling, tail position, tense tail,
											flashy tail, eyes open wide, nostrils flaring, breathing increase,
											chewing stops, ignores other things, stares, hyper vigilant, blows
											hard, snorts, calls out, backs up, tries to flee or run, rears,
											moves his feet, fights being restrained, feels trapped, attempts to
											move to open areas, tail activity increases, shows resistance, stops
											listening due to focusing on fear and many other things. Yet people
											still say, how do you know when you horse is scared. If you do not
											know how to listen or read your horse, then you will always be
											guessing. Some time you will guess right some time you will guess
											wrong, that will only show the horse you do not know what you are
											doing and he should not trust you and you are not a good confident
											leader and that will only increase the horse's fear and anxiety,
											which will increase his reactions to fear and will increase your
											fear and the cycle continues and escalates. Only you have the power
											to make it worse or make it better.</p>
										<p align="justify">Don't forget when a horse imagines fear, to the horse
											it is the same as real fear. No difference to the horse, they do not
											know the difference. If a horse perceives a plastic bag is a wolf
											that wants to eat him, to the horse it is a wolf, it does not matter
											that YOU know it is only a plastic bag. It then becomes your job to
											help the horse learn and understand it is not a wolf and only a
											plastic bag. You cannot lower a horse's fear with pain or force.
											Remember that, <strong>PAIN never lowers a horse's fear, it
												increases it.</strong> A little fact that most people can't seem
											to get. Far too often stupid humans forget the push pull
											polarization of a predator and a prey. Humans must learn to think
											and be like a prey, it is impossible for a prey to understand and
											become or be like a predator. The smarter of the two must come down
											to the lower of the two. Too often it is hard to tell who is really
											smarter.</p>

											when dealing with horse people. This picture was in a tack store.
											Notice the chain on the halter, notice it says Sweet Disposition and
											then has <u>NOT</u> underlined a child's horse, needs intermediate
											rider? ? What is really being said? I do not know the horse or owner
											but I would say, this horse is not handled well, not exposed to
											much, kept away from kids or maybe teased by kids and the owners
											could be either worried or scared of this horse.</p><br>

												src="images/horse&#32;for&#32;sale.jpg" width="280"> KEY words
											should raise red flags to those who pay attention. Unfortunately,
											most people buying this horse will only see how well groomed it is,
											how pretty it is and will hear "Sweet Disposition" so it must be
											loving. Most people think they are better riders than they are, so
											no one considers themselves a beginner rider so they are either
											intermediate or advanced, so this horse would be perfect??? So the
											horse will be sold to someone who can't handle it, won't know what
											to expect and then will be labeled wild, dangerous or out of control
											and then re-sold to someone who is an inexperienced buyer only to be
											taught more bad lessons by more stupid humans and will told by the
											horse that they are not as good as they think they are, but the
											horse will get blamed and will likely be destined to be re-sold
											several times. Could this add just be a perfect add for a great
											horse owned by great and honest owners? It could be, but in my
											experience, not likely. If you are critical and do more research,
											ask more questions, verify what is being said and prove your
											suspicions wrong, then you are being smarter and better prepared. Or
											you can just think everyone is nice and good, no would every lie and
											buy the this horse after reading the add? Either way, the horse has
											no options and no control over his future.</p>
										<p align="justify">I posted this and got comments saying the chain was
											just wrapped around the halter and was not hurting the horse. Here
											was my response to that uneducated eye: I don't care if the chain is
											lined with pink feathers, chains and horses are bad, chains cause
											pain, chains are used to intimidate or create fear to the horse, if
											you think that chain is just looped and is not used to pop, control
											or make sure the horse knows the chain is there and can be used,
											then you are missing the point and living in lala land. You are the
											blind man searching for the man with one eye. Grab the first blind
											man you see and ask him to lead you out of the burning building.
											Stop making excuses for people's ignorance, cruel techniques, dumb
											gimmicks and pain devices.</p>
										<p align="justify">I took down the Facebook page, too many negative
											women coming over, complaining, blaming and creating drama. Got
											tired of dealing with it and of course women won't correct rude
											petty bully women since they don't want to be the focus of their
											meanness, so it continues and gets worse and since if a man calls a
											woman out for it, he is just a sexist.</p>
										<p align="justify">Pretty horses are cursed to be owned by people that
											think looks equals good well-trained horse. Too bad for the pretty
											horses and pretty ponies, they are set up to fail for their beauty.
											This horse is very nice looking, that is all you can tell from a
											picture, but the words are warning you if you want to see it or hear
											it.</p>

											<strong><u>Illusion of Control:</u></strong>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">I talk about a movie called <a
												href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128278/"
												target="_blank"><strong>Instinct,</strong></a> where Anthony
											Hopkins lives with Gorillas and he is accepted into their herd and
											he talks about some very interesting concepts. A group of Gorillas
											are known as a band or troop, I think it is similar to horse herds,
											they have a hierarchy and pecking order, the males leave and the
											females tend to stay, they move together and take leadership from
											the Silverback (lead male), herd leader. In this movie the three
											things I think mirror or apply to horses are as follows -</p>
										<p align="justify">1) The lead Gorilla watches over his troop. He
											decides where to go for food and water and he controls the band.
											Anthony Hopkins is accepted into the herd, after the Silverback
											makes it clear that he is submissive to his leadership and authority
											and then watches over him. At one point in the movie Anthony said,
											It is an amazing feeling to be watched over. Unless you spend time
											in a herd and get accepted as part of or leader of a horse herd, you
											may not understand this, but once you have been accepted into a herd
											of horses, you can fully understand the impact of this statement
											about being watched over or protected.</p>
										<p align="justify">2) At another point he talks about "Takers". This is
											explained in the movie, but the short answer is those humans that
											take from everything they touch and never give back. Basically
											taking whatever they want regardless of the harm or negative
											consequences. The horse world has far too many "Takers". And since
											there is so much ignorance in the horse world, it makes it that much
											easier to take from the scared or fearful.</p>
										<p align="justify">3) And finally, in one part of the movie the concept
											of <strong>"Illusion of control"</strong> is discussed or is taught.
											This is how stupid humans think they are smarter and always in
											control, when in reality, they are never really in control, but they
											convince themselves that they are in control. This happens with many
											horse people. They think a bit stops a horse. <i>"Illusion of
												control".</i> They think they are smarter than horses.
											<i>"Illusion of control".</i> They think they can treat a horse
											however they want and it won't fight back or they think they can
											control a horse with force, fear and pain, both beliefs are
											dangerous <i>"Illusions of control".</i>
										</p>
										<p align="justify">The movie makes the topics clear and if you get a
											chance, take a look, it is a good movie with a good message and it
											just might teach you something about yourself, stupid humans and
											give you something you can apply to your horsemanship.</p>

										<p align="justify"></p>
										<center>
											<img border="0" height="300" src="images/red&#32;ribbon.jpg" width="300">
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">The cartoon is funny, but not knowing some things can
											get you hurt or killed around horses. Like knowing how a horse's
											vision works and where its blind spots are. Knowing that different
											horses are different learning experiences, so not all horses are the
											same and not all horses react the same. Knowing that being around a
											horse can be dangerous or safe, it is up to you. It is your
											responsibility to know what might happen before you blindly go
											around a strange horse. Helping, getting involved or handling
											unknown horses can get you hurt pretty damn fast and normally when
											that happens, the horse is blamed. Developing that critical eye and
											ear, never accepting anything for fact unless you prove it yourself,
											always understanding that horse are make to act bad or dangerous so
											never treat or approach a horse like YOU know what you are doing so
											nothing can wrong.</p>
										<p align="justify">This cartoon plays on the ignorance of the little
											girl, but it does not show the seriousness of this topic. It still
											amazes me how many people want to warn people, hey that horse will
											kick, hey be careful that horse will bite, watch out that horse will
											rear. Really, you feel the need to warn people of these things.
											Anyone around a horse that does not know this is a fool. Why don't
											people warn people, hey watch out that horse will eat and poop or
											watch out that can run???? The people warning foolish things are
											just as foolish as the people needing to be warned.</p>
										<p></p>
										<center>
											PS: A red ribbon tied to a horse's tail is a warning to others that
											the horse is known to kick, so be aware and stay clear of kicking
											range. Some people do this since they get nervous on trail rides
											when other horses get close so this keeps horses at a distance, but
											the fact is the horse has never kicked. <i>*Remember: believe
												nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see.</i>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">I am a big "Mind your own business". Let people be
											responsible for their actions. If you run over and try to warn or
											get involved, you may end up spooking the horse or causing what you
											are trying to prevent. So if you feel the need to get involved, you
											better be ready to get blamed and be responsible for what happens
											since you have a greater chance of causing problems then preventing
											them.</p>
										<p align="justify">So when do you get involved? The short answer is
											never. The long answer is "almost never."</p>

											<h3><strong>Stop Nagging your Horse:</strong></h3>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">Here is my take on this article and how it
												relates to understanding horses and understanding that what we
												do causes our horse to do what they do.</p>
											<p align="justify">An article that I found interesting was posted in
												the Wall Street Journal. Below are quotes from article about
												nagging.</p>
											<div class="indented">
												<p align="justify">"Experts say it is exactly the type of toxic
													communication that can eventually sink a relationship.
													Nagging the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes
													a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both
													become increasingly annoyed."</p>
											</div>
											<p align="justify">The above statement describes so many horse
												trainers and horse owners. People continue to do the same thing
												over and over and never seem to realize that what they keep
												repeating is NOT working and that they need to change what they
												are doing. So the horse gets more confused, learns to accept the
												nagging and asking as something that they just need to ignore or
												resist. The horse learns to adjust and ignore. Then the horse
												gets label as mean, lazy, bad, stupid or does not listen.</p>
											<div class="indented">
												<p align="justify">"Why do we nag? "We have a perception that we
													won't get what we want from the other person, so we feel we
													need to keep asking in order to get it," says Scott Wetzler,
													a psychologist and vice chairman of the Department of
													Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical
													Center in New York. It is a vicious circle: The naggee tires
													of the badgering and starts to withhold, which makes the
													nagger nag more."</p>
											</div>
											<p align="justify">The key to the above statements are nagging is a
												result of frustration, confusing and not getting what you want.
												How many horse owners does that apply to? Even if it does not
												work, the human continues to nag. Just like the horse when it is
												confused, scared, nervous, cornered or frustrated, the HORSE
												continues to resist, does not give the right answer and goes
												back to its instincts or flight, fear and fight. Neither grows
												or finds comfort, yet the majority of people continue to do what
												they do and horse continues to do what they do. Unless you can
												understand the horse has no choice and only knows how to be a
												horse, you will never develop a good trusting relationship with
												your horse.</p>
											<div class="indented">
												<p align="justify">"An extremely organized, obsessive or anxious
													person may not be able to refrain from giving reminders,
													especially if the partner is laid back and often does things
													at the last minute. Other people are naturally resistant
													some might say lazy and could bring out the nagger in
													anyone."</p>
											</div>
											<p align="justify">The above statement again points to YOU the
												human. If you are going to be around horses you must be more
												aware, you must be alert and ready to engage, act and react. You
												must be ready to give direction or re-direct the horse so to
												defuse the horse's natural instincts to run and flee. If you do
												this with timing, feel and rhythm then your horse will feel safe
												and comfortable and will look to you for guidance and assurance
												rather than see you as a fearful confused predator that hinders
												the horse rather than helps the horse. The horse is a mirror; it
												reflects back what it gets. If it gets good it gives good, if it
												gets bad, confusion, fear, or insecurity, then that is what it
												gives back.</p>
											<div class="indented">
												<p align="justify">"But women are more likely to nag, experts
													say, The problem is that by asking repeatedly, they make
													things worse. "Nagging is an enemy of love, if allowed to
													persist," Dr. Markman says. As long as I am not putting
													pressure on him, he seems to respond better. "There's no
													annoying tone of voice or body posture. It's all out of the
													equation." The first step in curbing the nagging cycle,
													experts say, is to admit that you are stuck in a bad
													pattern. You are fighting about fighting. You need to work
													to understand what makes the other person tick". I don't
													take it personally when he doesn't respond." "There is a
													sense of recognition about what's happening," Mr. Egurbide
													says. "It's easier to accommodate each other.""</p>
											</div>
											<p align="justify">In the above statement the language is so horse
												specific, it is funny. The woman above learns that nagging does
												not work and that when she changes what she does, she gets
												different and more desirable results. Amazing, when she changed
												and gave different messages, the answers also changed.
												Brilliant, that is exactly what horse owners need to realize.
												Every failure of your horse is your failure. Every wrong answer
												you get is a result of the wrong way to ask. Every bad thing
												your horse does is a result of YOU doing something in a bad or
												confusing way. A horse would always rather to avoid conflict and
												discomfort. However, the horse has to be shown the right way to
												avoid the pressure or discomfort. When people learn this, they
												will immediate progress in their horse. Which is why when you,
												the stupid human gets better, that is when your horse gets
												better.</p>

														<br>
														It's More Common Than Adultery and Potentially As Toxic,
														So Why Is It So Hard to Stop Nagging?</strong><br>
													<br>
													By ELIZABETH BERNSTEIN (Reprinted from Wall Street Journal
													Jan 2012)<br>
													<br>
													Ken Mac Dougall bit into the sandwich his wife had packed
													him for lunch and noticed something odd a Post-it note
													tucked between the ham and the cheese. He pulled it out of
													his mouth, smoothed the crinkles and read what his wife had
													written: "Be in aisle 10 of Home Depot tonight at 6 p.m."
													Marriage counselors warn that nagging is one of the leading
													causes for discord and divorce, Elizabeth Bernstein reports
													on Lunch Break.<br>
													<br>
													Mr. Mac Dougall was renovating the couple's Oak Ridge, N.J.,
													kitchen, and his wife had been urging him to pick out the
													floor tiles. He felt he had plenty of time to do this task.
													She felt unheard.<br>
													<br>
													"I thought the note was an ingenious and hysterical way to
													get his attention," says his wife, Janet Pfeiffer (whose
													occupation, interestingly enough, is a motivational
													speaker), recalling the incident which occurred several
													years ago. Her husband, a technician at a company that
													modifies vehicles for handicapped drivers, did not really
													see it that way. "I don't need a reminder in the middle of
													my sandwich," he says.<br>
													<br>
													Nagging <strong>the interaction in which one person
														repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly
														ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed
													</strong>is an issue every couple will grapple with at some
													point. While the word itself can provoke chuckles and eye
													rolling, the dynamic can potentially be as dangerous to a
													marriage as adultery or bad finances. Experts say it is
													exactly the type of <strong>toxic communication that can
														eventually sink a relationship.</strong><br>
													<br>
													Why do we nag? "We have a perception that we won't get what
													we want from the other person, so we feel we need to keep
													asking in order to get it," says Scott Wetzler, a
													psychologist and vice chairman of the Department of
													Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical
													Center in New York. <strong>It is a vicious circle: The
														naggee tires of the badgering and starts to withhold,
														which makes the nagger nag more.</strong><br>
													<br>
													Personality contributes to the dynamic, Dr. Wetzler says. An
													extremely organized, <strong>obsessive or anxious
														person</strong> may not be able to refrain from giving
													reminders, especially if the partner is laid back and often
													does things at the last minute. Other people are naturally
													resistant some might say lazy and could bring out the nagger
													in anyone.<br>
													<br>
													It is possible for husbands to nag, and wives to resent them
													for nagging. <strong><u>But women are more likely to nag,
															experts say,</u></strong><u></u> largely because
													they are conditioned to feel more responsible for managing
													home and family life. In addition, they tend to be more
													sensitive to early signs of problems in a relationship. When
													women ask for something and do not get a response, they are
													quicker to realize something is wrong. <u>The problem is
														that by asking repeatedly, they make things
														worse.</u><br>
													<br>
													Men are to blame, too, because they do not always give a
													clear answer. Sure, a husband might tune his wife out
													because he is annoyed; nagging can make him feel like a
													little boy being scolded by his mother. But many times he
													doesn't respond because he doesn't know the answer yet, or
													he knows the answer will disappoint her.<br>
													<br>
													Nagging can become a prime contributor to divorce when
													couples start fighting about the nagging rather than talking
													about the issue at the root of the nagging, say Howard
													Markman, professor of psychology at the University of Denver
													and co-director of the Center for Marital and Family
													Studies. For 30 years, Dr. Markman has researched conflict
													and communication in relationships and offered relationship
													counseling and marriage seminars. He says that while all
													couples deal with nagging at some point, those who learn to
													reduce this type of negative communication will
													substantially increase their odds of staying together and
													keeping love alive. Couples who don't learn often fall out
													of love and split up.<br>
													<br>
													Research that Dr. Markman published in 2010 in the Journal
													of Family Psychology indicates that couples who became
													unhappy five years into their marriage had a roughly 20%
													increase in negative communication patterns consistent with
													nagging, and a 12% decrease in positive communication.
													"Nagging is an enemy of love, if allowed to persist," Dr.
													Markman says.<br>
													<br>
													The good news: Couples can learn to stop nagging. Early in
													their marriage, Ms. Pfeiffer, now 62, repeatedly reminded
													her husband about household tasks and became more demanding
													when he ignored her. "If I was asking him to take care of
													something that mattered to me and he was blowing me off,
													that made me feel like I didn't matter," she says.<br>
													<br>
													Mr. Mac Dougall, 58, says the nagging made his muscles
													tense, he would become silent and his eyes would glaze over
													in a "thousand-yard stare." "Her requests conveyed some sort
													of urgency that I didn't think was needed," he says. "If I
													said I was going to get to it, I would definitely get to
													it."<br>
													<br>
													Ms. Pfeiffer decided to <strong>soften her approach. She
														asked herself, "How can I speak in a way that is not
														threatening or offensive to him?"</strong> She began
													writing requests on Post-it notes, adding little smiley
													faces or hearts. Mr. Mac Dougall says he was initially
													peeved about the sandwich note but did show up at Home Depot
													that evening smiling. Ms. Pfeiffer sometimes writes notes to
													him from the appliances that need to be fixed. "I really
													need your help," a recent plea began. "I am really backed up
													and in a lot of discomfort." It was signed "your faithful
													bathtub drain." "As long as I am not putting pressure on
													him, he seems to respond better," Ms. Pfeiffer says. Mr. Mac
													Dougall agrees. "The notes distract me from the face-to-face
													interaction," he says. "There's no annoying tone of voice or
													body posture. It's all out of the equation."<br>
													<br>
													The first step in curbing the nagging cycle, experts say, is
													to <u><strong>admit that you are stuck in a bad
															pattern.</strong></u> You are fighting about
													fighting. You need to work to understand what makes the
													other person tick. Rather than lazy and unloving, is your
													husband overworked and tired? Is your wife really suggesting
													she doesn't trust you? Or is she just trying to keep track
													of too many chores?<br>
													<br>
													Noreen Egurbide, 44, of Westlake Village, Calif., says she
													used to give her husband frequent reminders to take out the
													garbage, get the car serviced or pick up the kids from
													school. "I thought I was helping him," she says. Jose
													Egurbide, 47, often waited a while before doing what she
													asked. The couple would argue. Sometimes Ms. Egurbide would
													just do it herself.<br>
													<br>
													A few years ago, they got insight into their nagging problem
													after taking a problem-solving assessment test, the Kolbe
													Assessment. Ms. Egurbide, a business coach, learned she is a
													strategic planner who gathers facts and organizes in
													advance. Her husband, an attorney, learned that he is
													resistant to being boxed into a plan. Now, Ms. Egurbide
													says, <u><strong>"I don't take it personally when he doesn't
															respond." "There is a sense of recognition about
															what's happening," Mr. Egurbide says. "It's easier
															to accommodate each
															other."</strong></u><strong></strong>

											</div>
											<p align="justify">To me this is a really good example of emotional
												perception and physical reality. Women that do not have a baby
												will relate to the top peaceful loving picture and women that
												have had children will understand the lower picture as
												realistic. Of course both pictures are correct and both may
												happen, but neither is absolute or will happen all the time.</p>
											<p align="justify">Much like in horses, many see their horse
												relationship as calm, loving, peaceful and harmony, yet in
												reality they have no concept of what it takes to achieve that
												type of relationship. A person who thinks breeding is important
												will find beauty in a horse with papers. A person that loves
												Thoroughbreds will find good in them, just like a person who
												does not like Arabs will find fault with them.</p>
											<p align="justify">A horse is a horse and that is all they know.
												Seeing things in them will not change them or make what you see
												true. Loving a horse will not create a bond or trust. Believing
												your horse loves you will not make the horse better or more
												trustworthy.</p>
											<p align="justify"><strong>There are none so blind as those who are
													unwilling to see.</strong> Breaking down our belief system
												is very difficult and does not happen easily. There are many
												strong and perpetuated beliefs in the horse world. Most are very
												wrong and hurt the horse. However, trying to undo this
												bombardment of ignorance is an uphill battle and many will fight
												to be right and refuse to hear another way. I say it often but
												it is still rare in the horse world, the best gift you can give
												to your horse - is understanding of the horse.</p>

												<strong><u>Why Slow is Faster with Horses:</u></strong>
											</center><strong><u></u></strong><u></u>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">You may have heard, and I say this as well, the
												slow way is the fast way with horses. However, what does that
												really mean? Going slow with progression is good, but not so
												slow that learning is lost. A horse can be challenged or can be
												bored. A horse can learn that there is a right answer so it will
												look for it and try and find it or it can learn that I just get
												harassed and pushed and there is no right answer or I can't find
												the right answer so I will stop trying to find a right answer.
												Obviously, you want the first and not the latter.</p>
											<p align="justify">Speed of how fast a horse learns depends on many
												factors. Things like experience of the person, experience of the
												horse, knowledge of the person teaching, understanding of how to
												read a horse, how to talk to a horse, timing and when to give
												pressure and when to give release, smooth rhythm to work with
												the horse and not against the horse, understanding of how to
												know if the horse is confused, frustrated, bored, inattentive or
												if the horse is being disrespectful or resistant or if the horse
												is trying. All of these factors will either help the horse learn
												faster or prevent the horse from learning or will teach the
												horse the wrong lesson.</p>
											<p align="justify"></p>
											<center>
												<b><u>Secret Tip:</u></b><u></u> If you act like you have all
												day it will only take minutes. If you act like you only have
												minutes to teach something, it will take all day.
											</center>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">So how do you know all this? -- Time, experience,
												patience, understanding of the horse and pay attention and
												listen to the horse. Of course, you may think you are paying
												attention and you may think you understand what the horse is
												saying and you may be wrong. This is why horsemanship is not as
												easy as it looks. Yet on every bookshelf or every video for sale
												or every special training equipment for sale, you will be told
												there are shortcuts or special secrets to get all the answers
												quick and fast. No right answers, no special fix, no secret
												trick or gimmick.</p>
											<p align="justify">So has this answered the question or made you
												think of more questions? Bottom line - Learn to understand the
												horse, learn to listen and learn from the horse, then all things
												become easier.</p>

												still like the old west, no controls, everyone is on their own
												and buyer beware. No controls on papers, breeding, ownership,
												certifications, licensing, sellers, buyers, traders, drugs,
												care; so horses are on their own and have little or no

												the horse has done for mankind.</p>

														Horse" should only be judged from the standard of a
														horse. Humans judge things from their perspective. Many
														see a horse as a pet like a dog or cat. A dog or cat is
														very different from a horse. The biggest difference I
														see is the <strong>"FEAR."</strong> A dog or cat cannot
														kill you by accident and they cannot cripple you for
														life. The large size, strength and gentleness of horses
														draw people to them, and these same things push or keep
														people at a distance. The horse sees this fear as
														confusion, weakness or lack of leadership and trust. A
														phenomenon many people experience.<br>
														<br>
														Horses can run, jump, survive in the wild, raise their
														young and thrive in the wild without human involvement.
														They are exceptional at living in a herd, protecting
														their young and being horses. <strong>It is only when
															humans get involved and tries to improve or teach a
															horse to be domesticated, that the horse
															fails.</strong> It is only when the humans try to
														teach horses better that they suffer and fail.
														<strong>The success of the horse is unchallenged as long
															as humans stay out of it.</strong> If I were to
														judge a human compared to a horse, the human would fail
														every time. A human cannot run as fast a horse, cannot
														jump as far, cannot communicate as well as the horse,
														cannot smell as good as a horse, cannot hear as good,
														cannot work as hard, cannot pull or carry as much and
														cannot be as forgiving as the horse. I think humans know
														that horses are better, which is why humans are so
														attracted to horses, since opposites attract and people
														seek in others what they lack themselves. Weak people
														tend to have strong friends or partners, sometime to the
														extreme. I have been known to say <strong>"Horse people
															have issues."</strong> Many people write me and
														agree with that, but most all think they are exception
														to this rule. People that collect horses normally have
														more issues, RE: the "Buck Movie" lady.<br>
														<br>
														I digress; the point of this is to remind people that
														horses are fine without us. Horses only fail with the
														help of humans. Lastly, when judging a horse as right or

												how make her horse safe, since she did not want to hurt. I told

												restrictive trailer or in an aircraft; it is still stress on a
												horse. Anytime a horse is moved there are many stresses that are
												put on the horse. Things like change in food, water, environment
												and other things. When a horse is stressed, it changes his
												systems, he is more prone to colic, his immune system is
												compromised, his inability to move or walk around or graze all
												creates stress. Then you add in that many people drug a horse
												for trips for either for stress or motion sickness and that is

												<strong>The Story of the Snake and the Rabbit:</strong>
											</center>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">Once there was this rabbit and snake that met at
												the edge of the river. Both needed to get across to the other
												side. Since the snake could not swim, he asked the rabbit if he
												would let him ride on his back to get across the river.<br>
												<br>
												The rabbit said no way, I know what you are up to, you want to
												get on my back so you can bite me. The protested and said he
												would not bite him since if he bit him, they would both drown.
												The rabbit thought about it and agreed to carry the snake across
												the river.<br>
												<br>
												The snake got on the rabbits back and the rabbit started
												swimming across the river. As they got to the middle of the
												river, the snake bit the rabbit.<br>
												<br>
												The rabbit was shocked and confused and asked the snake, why did
												you bite me, now we both are going to die. The snake replied, "I
												can't help it, it is my nature."<br>
												<br>
												It is a horse's nature to be fearful and careful. It does not
												trust new things because their instinct says stay alive be ready
												to run and do not be cornered or trapped. Almost all things we
												do to a horse is against its nature, so have patience and
												understanding. Realize and accept that the horse is not being
												mean or stupid, it is being a horse and that is its nature.

												One Vietnam veteran, an old retired colonel, once said this to
												me: "Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind,
												gentle, productive creatures who can only hurt one another by
												accident." This is true. Remember, the murder rate is six per
												100,000 per year, and the aggravated assault rate is four per
												1,000 per year. What this means is that the vast majority of
												Americans are not inclined to hurt one another. Some estimates
												say that two million Americans are victims of violent crimes
												every year, a tragic, staggering number, perhaps an all-time
												record rate of violent crime. But there are almost 300 million
												Americans, which means that the odds of being a victim of
												violent crime is considerably less than one in a hundred on any
												given year. Furthermore, since many violent crimes are committed
												by repeat offenders, the actual number of violent citizens is
												considerably less than two million.<br>
												<br>
												Thus there is a paradox, and we must grasp both ends of the
												situation: We may well be in the most violent times in history,
												but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most
												citizens are kind, decent people who are not capable of hurting
												each other, except by accident or under extreme provocation.
												They are sheep.<br>
												<br>
												I mean nothing negative by calling them sheep. To me it is like
												the pretty, blue robin's egg. Inside it is soft and gooey but
												someday it will grow into something wonderful. But the egg
												cannot survive without its hard blue shell. Police officers,
												soldiers, and other warriors are like that shell, and someday
												the civilization they protect will grow into something
												wonderful.? For now, though, they need warriors to protect them
												from the predators.<br>
												<br>
												"Then there are the wolves," the old war veteran said, "and the
												wolves feed on the sheep without mercy." Do you believe there
												are wolves out there who will feed on the flock without mercy?
												You better believe it. There are evil men in this world and they
												are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend
												it is not so, you become a sheep. There is no safety in
												denial.<br>
												<br>
												"Then there are sheepdogs," he went on, "and I'm a sheepdog. I
												live to protect the flock and confront the wolf." If you have no
												capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen,
												a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for
												your fellow citizens, then you have defined an aggressive
												sociopath, a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence,
												and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then?
												A sheepdog, a warrior, someone who is walking the hero's path.
												Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness, into the
												universal human phobia, and walk out unscathed.<br>
												<br>
												Let me expand on this old soldier's excellent model of the
												sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. We know that the sheep live in
												denial, that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to
												believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the
												fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire
												extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms and fire exits
												throughout their kids' schools.<br>
												<br>
												But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed
												police officer in their kid's school. Our children are thousands
												of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school
												violence than fire, but the sheep's only response to the
												possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to
												kill or harm their child is just too hard, and so they chose the
												path of denial.<br>
												<br>
												The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot
												like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The
												difference, though, is that the sheepdog must not, cannot and
												will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog who intentionally
												harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The
												world cannot work any other way, at least not in a
												representative democracy or a republic such as ours.<br>
												<br>
												Still, the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant
												reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer
												that he didn't tell them where to go, or give them traffic
												tickets, or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage
												fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the
												sheepdog cash in his fangs, spray paint himself white, and go,
												"Baa."<br>
												<br>
												Until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately
												to hide behind one lonely sheepdog. The students, the victims,
												at Columbine High School were big, tough high school students,
												and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the
												time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they
												just had nothing to say to a cop. When the school was under
												attack, however, and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and
												hallways, the officers had to physically peel those clinging,
												sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel
												about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.<br>
												<br>
												Look at what happened after September 11, 2001 when the wolf
												pounded hard on the door. Remember how America, more than ever
												before, felt differently about their law enforcement officers
												and military personnel? Remember how many times you heard the
												word hero?<br>
												<br>
												Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a
												sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that
												a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out
												on the perimeter, checking the breeze, barking at things that go
												bump in the night, and yearning for a righteous battle. That is,
												the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old
												sheepdogs are a little older and wiser, but they move to the
												sound of the guns when needed right along with the young
												ones.<br>
												<br>
												Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The
												sheep pretend the wolf will never come, but the sheepdog lives
												for that day. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, most of
												the sheep, that is, most citizens in America said, "Thank God I
												wasn't on one of those planes." The sheepdogs, the warriors,
												said, "Dear God, I wish I could have been on one of those
												planes. Maybe I could have made a difference." When you are
												truly transformed into a warrior and have truly invested
												yourself into warriorhood, you want to be there. You want to be
												able to make a difference.<br>
												<br>
												There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog, the
												warrior, but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that
												is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that
												destroys 98 percent of the population. There was research
												conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent
												crimes. These cons were in prison for serious, predatory crimes
												of violence: assaults, murders and killing law enforcement
												officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted
												victims by body language: slumped walk, passive behavior and
												lack of awareness. They chose their victims like big cats do in
												Africa, when they select one out of the herd that is least able
												to protect itself.<br>
												<br>
												Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be
												genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that
												most people can choose which one they want to be, and I'm proud
												to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become
												sheepdogs. Seven months after the attack on September 11, 2001,
												Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury, New Jersey.
												Todd, as you recall, was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania
												who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United
												Airlines about the hijacking. When he learned of the other three
												passenger planes that had been used as weapons, Todd dropped his
												phone and uttered the words, "Let's roll," which authorities
												believe was a signal to the other passengers to confront the
												terrorist hijackers. In one hour, a transformation occurred
												among the passengers - athletes, business people and parents. --
												from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves,
												ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.<br>
												<br>
												There is no safety for honest men except by believing all
												possible evil of evil men. - Edmund Burke Here is the point I
												like to emphasize, especially to the thousands of police
												officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep,
												real sheep, are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way, and
												so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a
												critter. As a human being, you can be whatever you want to be.
												It is a conscious, moral decision. If you want to be a sheep,
												then you can be a sheep and that is okay, but you must
												understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes, you and your
												loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to
												protect you. If you want to be a wolf, you can be one, but the
												sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have
												rest, safety, trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog
												and walk the warrior's path, then you must make a conscious and
												moral decision every day to dedicate, equip and prepare yourself
												to thrive in that toxic, corrosive moment when the wolf comes
												knocking at the door.<br>
												<br>
												For example, many officers carry their weapons in church? They
												are well concealed in ankle holsters, shoulder holsters or
												inside-the-belt holsters tucked into the small of their backs.?
												Anytime you go to some form of religious service, there is a
												very good chance that a police officer in your congregation is
												carrying. You will never know if there is such an individual in
												your place of worship, until the wolf appears to massacre you
												and your loved ones. I was training a group of police officers
												in Texas, and during the break, one officer asked his friend if
												he carried his weapon in church. The other cop replied, "I will
												never be caught without my gun in church." I asked why he felt
												so strongly about this, and he told me about a cop he knew who
												was at a church massacre in Ft. Worth, Texas in 1999. In that
												incident, a mentally deranged individual came into the church
												and opened fire, gunning down fourteen people. He said that
												officer believed he could have saved every life that day if he
												had been carrying his gun. His own son was shot, and all he
												could do was throw himself on the boy's body and wait to die.
												That cop looked me in the eye and said, "Do you have any idea
												how hard it would be to live with yourself after that?"<br>
												<br>
												Some individuals would be horrified if they knew this police
												officer was carrying a weapon in church. They might call him
												paranoid and would probably scorn him. Yet these same
												individuals would be enraged and would call for "heads to roll"
												if they found out that the airbags in their cars were defective,
												or that the fire extinguisher and fire sprinklers in their kids'
												school did not work. They can accept the fact that fires and
												traffic accidents can happen and that there must be safeguards
												against them.<br>
												<br>
												Their only response to the wolf, though, is denial, and all too
												often their response to the sheepdog is scorn and disdain. But
												the sheepdog quietly asks himself, "Do you have and idea how
												hard it would be to live with yourself if your loved ones
												attacked and killed, and you had to stand there helplessly
												because you were unprepared for that day?"<br>
												<br>
												It is denial that turns people into sheep. Sheep are
												psychologically destroyed by combat because their only defense
												is denial, which is counterproductive and destructive, resulting
												in fear, helplessness and horror when the wolf shows up .<br>
												<br>
												Denial kills you twice. It kills you once, at your moment of
												truth when you are not physically prepared: you didn't bring
												your gun, you didn't train. Your only defense was wishful
												thinking. Hope is not a strategy. Denial kills you a second time
												because even if you do physically survive, you are
												psychologically shattered by your fear helplessness and horror
												at your moment of truth.<br>
												<br>
												Gavin de Becker puts it like this in Fear Less, his superb
												post-9/11 book, which should be required reading for anyone
												trying to come to terms with our current world situation:
												"...denial can be seductive, but it has an insidious side
												effect. For all the peace of mind deniers think they get by
												saying it isn't so, the fall they take when faced with new
												violence is all the more unsettling."<br>
												<br>
												Denial is a save-now-pay-later scheme, a contract written
												entirely in small print, for in the long run, the denying person
												knows the truth on some level. And so the warrior must strive to
												confront denial in all aspects of his life, and prepare himself
												for the day when evil comes. If you are warrior who is legally
												authorized to carry a weapon and you step outside without that
												weapon, then you become a sheep, pretending that the bad man
												will not come today. No one can be "on" 24/7, for a lifetime.
												Everyone needs down time. But if you are authorized to carry a
												weapon, and you walk outside without it, just take a deep
												breath, and say this to yourself "Baa."<br>
												<br>
												This business of being a sheep or a sheep dog is not a yes-no
												dichotomy. It is not an all-or-nothing, either-or choice. It is
												a matter of degrees, a continuum. On one end is an abject,
												head-in-the-sand-sheep and on the other end is the ultimate
												warrior. Few people exist completely on one end or the other.
												Most of us live somewhere in between. Since 9-11 almost everyone
												in America took a step up that continuum, away from denial. The
												sheep took a few steps toward accepting and appreciating their
												warriors, and the warriors started taking their job more
												seriously. The degree to which you move up that continuum, away
												from sheephood and denial, is the degree to which you and your
												loved ones will survive, physically and psychologically at your
												moment of truth.

												over power them since they are younger and weaker.<br>
												<br>
												Both these beliefs are false. What really happens is people

												weak horse that cannot fight back very well. What they are
												really doing is very different. They are stealing rides and
												youth from young horses. They are falsely convincing themselves

												I get so many questions and request for help from people who
												love horses and but are scared of them. If you expect a horse to
												hurt you, the odds are you and your actions or reactions will
												make that expectation come true. Most people avoid things that
												scare them. However, with horses, their beauty, size and
												strength attract people that are scared of them. This
												combination is not good for horse or human. Since horses are so
												observant and pay such close attention to body language, they
												know fear, they know mistrust, their instincts tell them to be
												mistrusting of predators. So a horse's fear is very natural,
												instinctual and very misunderstood by humans. Humans think they
												are smarter and at the top of all animals, our instinct is to
												conquer and control. Not the best approach to work and develop a

														comfortable his face, tight lips, pinned ears all say
														nervous and insecure. No saddle pad means the saddle is
														probably hurting the back and putting pressure points on
														the horses back. The REAR CINCH is extremely dangerous.
														Since there is not cinch connector between the front and
														rear cinch, the cinch is allowed to slide back in the
														Flank area of the horse where it irritates the sensitive
														under belly, which is exactly where they put it on
														Bucking horses, to make them buck. Now, when this horse
														bucks or flips over, the horse will be killed or put

												<strong><u>Making a Difference</u></strong>
											</center><strong><u></u></strong>
											<p></p>
											<p>I am often told that what I am doing will never change
												<strong>The Horse World</strong> since it is too far gone and
												too much money involved. So I tell this story:
											</p>
											<div class="indented">
												<p>There was once an old man and a child walking on the beach
													together. While walking they approach an area where
													thousands of fish are washed up on the beach flipping and
													flopping on the sand.<br>
													<br>
													The little boy picks up one of the fish and throws it back
													in the water.<br>
													<br>
													The old man laughs and says: "You think you can make a
													difference in all these 1000's of dying fish by doing
													that?"<br>
													<br>
													The boy looks up at the man and says: "It made a difference
													for that one."

												<u><strong>The Story of an Ass and a Married
														Couple:</strong></u>
											</center><u><strong></strong></u><strong></strong><br>
											<br>
											<center>
												<img border="0" height="350" src="images2/donkey&#32;story.jpg"
													width="400">
											</center><br>
											<br>
											Once there was a couple that had a donkey. This couple traveled a
											long road to and from the market through several villages.<br>
											<br>
											As they passed the first village, they were riding the donkey and
											the people said they were mean for making the donkey carry them, so
											they got off and walked with the donkey.<br>
											<br>
											At the next village, the people said they were stupid for walking
											and one should ride the donkey. So the man let his wife ride.<br>
											<br>
											At the next village, the people said the wife should be a better
											wife and since her husband worked all day in the fields that she
											should let him ride. So they switched.<br>
											<br>
											At the last village, right before they had to cross a long swinging
											bridge across a large ravine, the people said they should be ashamed
											that they made their mule carry them since it worked and plowed
											their fields for the food they ate and that should carry the donkey
											and not make him walk. So they picked up the donkey and carried
											him.<br>
											<br>
											While crossing the swinging bridge, the wind blew, making the bridge
											swing and the couple dropped their donkey to it's death.<br>
											<br>
											<strong>The moral to the story:</strong><br>
											<br>
											<center>
												You cannot please everyone all the time and if you try, you will
												lose your ass.
											</center><br>
											<br>
											You will get lots of free advice in the horse world from people who
											think they know best - don't do things to your horse that can get it
											hurt or risk danger - just because lots of people give free advice.
											Your horse, your responsibility - the horse does not care if the
											advice was bad and caused the injury or death. However, it is a nice
											easy excuse for lazy people to blame others for what they do their
											horse.

												<u><strong>My Advice To People that Say I am Mean</strong></u>
											</center><u><strong></strong></u><strong></strong><br>
											<br>
											OK let me get this straight - you buy a 1200 pound wild reactionary
											instinctive flight or fight animal that has the power and ability to
											kill you or hurt you - you don't do your homework or research before
											you buy and now that you own this horse, you finally figure out not
											knowing what you are doing could get you hurt or killed - so you
											seek me out, ask me for help and say I don't like the way you talk,
											and you do not make me feel loved, so I don't want your help.<br>
											<br>
											<strong>Brilliant</strong> - in other words I would rather risk my
											life then get information that could save me?<br>
											<br>
											When people tell me this I refer them to my <strong>Mean Directions
												Story:</strong><br>
											<br>
											When you are lost and driving in the wrong direction heading for
											danger, running out of gas and you stop and ask for directions, if
											the person that tells you which way to go, but says it mean - Do you
											continue to go in the wrong direction just for spite until you find
											someone who gives you directions nicely? If you do - you give a new
											meaning to what a fool is.

												<u><strong>The story goes: Marcus Aurelius Was a Roman Emperor,
														Horseman & Philosopher</strong></u>
											</center><u><strong></strong></u><strong></strong>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">I am reminded of a story when I see people
												worshiping the so called great horse whisperers, trainers &
												Natural Horsemen. These people follow without question, admire
												and worship these so called great men and women. I also see
												these same famous people becoming arrogant and using the horse
												for their fame, for profit and forgetting that <strong>- A horse
													is still a horse without a horseman - But a Horseman is only
													a man without a horse.</strong><br>
												<br>
												As the&nbsp;legend has it, Marcus Aurelius being fully aware of
												how power can corrupt a man, he hired a servant to follow him as
												he walked the empire's streets. Every time a citizen bowed to
												him, took a knee for him or called out some compliment or word
												of praise, Marcus Aurelius instructed the&nbsp;servant to
												whisper in his ear, <strong>"You're just a man. You're just a
													man."</strong><br>
												<br>
												He knew that the best way to test a man's character was to give
												him power and fame.<br>

											Until you have been put in a tree by a bull, you really can't
											appreciate the full meaning of this sign. When I was kid, me and a
											buddy were killing time in Texas, looking for pop bottles, walking
											railroad tracks and playing with cows. We decided to to mess a cow
											in a pasture and see if we could tip it over. About 3/4 of the way
											in, we realized it was not a cow but was a bull. We the chasers
											became the runners. Lucky for us there was a large tree in the
											middle of this pasture. We managed to beat the bull up the tree and
											thought we won, we were all happy to be alive and high fiving. The
											bull then decided to lay down under the tree in the shade. Three
											hours later, after peeing from a tree, the bull was not moving.
											About a hour later, the bull started grazing and got a little
											distance from the tree and we decided to make our move. Two dumass
											kids running for our lives, jumping a barbed wire fence at mach 1,
											only stopping after we were on the other side of the fence, where we
											decided to talk smack to the bull. That was our last cow tipping
											adventure. Wish this sign was posted on that pasture.

												<strong><u>The Story of a Chinese Farmer</u></strong>
											</center><br>
											<br>
											Once upon a time there was a Chinese Farmer who lost a horse and the
											horse ran away.<br>
											<br>
											And that evening all neighbors came around and said that's too
											bad<br>
											<br>
											And the Farmer said, Maybe?<br>
											<br>
											And the next day the horse returned and brought with him seven other
											wild horses.<br>
											<br>
											And that evening all the neighbors came and said that is great isn't
											it.<br>
											<br>
											And the Framer said, Maybe?<br>
											<br>
											The next day his son was riding and trying to tame one of the horses
											and was thrown and broke his leg.<br>
											<br>
											And all the neighbors came and said that is really bad isn't it<br>
											<br>
											And the Framer said, Maybe?<br>
											<br>
											The next day the army officers came by looking for soldiers and they
											saw his son had a broken leg and so they rejected his son because of
											the broken leg.<br>
											<br>
											And all the neighbors came and said isn't the wonderful<br>
											<br>
											And the Framer said Maybe?<br>
											<br>
											The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
											complexity and it is really impossible to tell weather anything that
											happens is either good or bad.<br>
											<br>
											Because you never know what will be the consequences of the
											misfortunes and you never know what will be the consequences of good
											fortune.<br>
											<br>
											<i><strong>**When you see a horse know that he does not know right
													or wrong. Those words have no meaning to a horse. They know
													instincts, survival, release of pressure, consequences of
													their decision, easy or hard, looking for the right response
													for them to find comfort and release of pressure and or
													safety. When learning a horse does not know if something is
													good or bad or what will be the consequences will be,

												<strong><u>The Five Monkeys Experiment</u></strong>
											</center><strong><u></u></strong> <u></u><br>
											<br>
											An experimenter puts 5 monkeys in a large cage. High up at the top
											of the cage, well beyond the reach of the monkeys, is a bunch of
											bananas. Underneath the bananas is a ladder.<br>
											<br>
											The monkeys immediately spot the bananas and one begins to climb the
											ladder. As he does, however, the experimenter sprays him with a
											stream of cold water. Then, he proceeds to spray each of the other
											monkeys.<br>
											<br>
											The monkey on the ladder scrambles off. And all 5 sit for a time on
											the floor, wet, cold, and bewildered. Soon, though, the temptation
											of the bananas is too great, and another monkey begins to climb the
											ladder. Again, the experimenter sprays the ambitious monkey with
											cold water and all the other monkeys as well. When a third monkey
											tries to climb the ladder, the other monkeys, wanting to avoid the
											cold spray, pull him off the ladder and beat him. The monkeys
											learned to associate going up the ladder with getting sprayed.<br>
											<br>
											Now one monkey is removed and a new monkey is introduced to the
											cage. Spotting the bananas, he naively begins to climb the ladder.
											The other monkeys pull him off and beat him.<br>
											<br>
											Here's where it gets interesting. The experimenter removes a second
											one of the original monkeys from the cage and replaces him with a
											new monkey. Again, the new monkey begins to climb the ladder and,
											again, the other monkeys pull him off and beat him including the
											monkey who had never been sprayed. Each original monkey is removed
											until no monkey that has ever been sprayed is still in the cage.<br>
											<br>
											By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys were left
											and yet, despite none of them ever experiencing the cold, wet,
											spray, they had all learned never to try and go for the bananas and
											they would continue to beat any new monkey that tied.<br>
											<br>
											If you could ask the Monkeys why they don't go for the Banana and
											why they beat others for trying, they would probably say:<br>
											<br>
											That is just how it has always been done.<br>
											<br>
											So, when people ask me why people still use archaic pain bits, horse
											shoes and barbaric training practices on horses, my answer is no
											good reason except "That is just how it has always been done."

											Once there was an old man walking on the beach. Early one morning,
											he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and saw
											the beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see,
											thousands of fish dying on the sand, stretching in both directions.
											<br><br>

											Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching. As
											the boy walked, the man could see that he was occasionally bending
											down to pick up a starfish and would throw it back into the sea. Has
											the boy got closer, the man called asked, what are you
											doing?"<br><br>

											The young boy replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide
											has washed them up onto the beach and they can't return to the sea
											by themselves, When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw
											them back into the water."<br><br>

											The old man replied, "But there must be tens of thousands of
											starfish on this beach. I'm afraid you won't really be able to make
											much of a difference by throwing a few back in."<br><br>

											The boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it back into
											the ocean. Then he turned, smiled and said to the old man, "It made
											a difference to that one! "

											<strong>HOW IS YOUR MORALS?</strong>
										</center>
										<p align="justify"> This is a great little test and appears somewhat
											accurate. I have given this several people over the years and it is
											right more than it is wrong.<br>
											<br>
											How moral are you? What is your attitude to morals, sex and honesty?
											The fascinating personality test below was written by a Sydney
											marriage expert who is a qualified psychologist. It began as a
											dinner party conversation gimmick, but it has been prepared in this
											form for readers to test themselves. To do the "test" you must give
											your honest opinion about morals and honesty of the four characters
											in our story of Sherwood Forest. Forget any preconceived ideas you
											may about them - this is a different sort of story from all the
											others.<br>
											<br>
											<strong>"The Sheriff of Nottingham captured Little John and Robin
												Hood and imprisoned them in his maximum - security dungeon. Maid
												Marion begged the Sheriff for their release, pleading her love
												for Robin. The Sheriff agreed to release them only if Maid
												Marion spent the night with him. To this she agreed. The next
												morning the Sheriff released his prisoners. Robin at once
												demanded that Marion tell him how she persuaded the Sheriff to
												let them go free. Marion confessed the truth, and was bewildered
												when Robin abused her, calling her a slut, and saying that he
												never wanted to see her again. At this Little John defended her,
												inviting her to leave Sherwood with him and promising life-long
												devotion. She accepted and they rode away
												together."</strong><br>
											<br>
											Now in terms of realistic everyday standards of behavior, put Robin,
											Marion, Little John, and the Sheriff in the order in which you
											consider they showed the most morality and honesty. There is no
											"right" answer, and the following is the psychologist's estimate of
											you for each of the 24 arrangements.
										</p>
										<p></p>
										<hr>
										<p align="justify"><strong>Conclusions:</strong><br>
											<br>
											1. ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You find it hard to accept
											the permissive attitudes of others, or to convince them of the
											validity of your own standards. You are not disposed to trust people
											and do not have a very happy life. (Men) To you "love" involves sex
											and duty, rather than charity and forgiveness. (Women) You blame men
											for much of the unhappiness in your life.<br>
											<br>
											2. ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: Your philosophy of life is a
											hotchpotch of the conventions of society, your own convictions and
											romanticism. You are not unkind, only staid and unimaginative. (Men)
											You see a woman as weak but desirable. (Women) Your resent the
											arrogance of men.<br>
											<br>
											3. ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN: As a ruthless authoritarian
											you are as moral as it suits you and no more. You do not apply the
											same rules to men as you do to women. (Men) We think you are
											unhappy, although you probably will not admit it. (Women) How
											worthless you seem to think women are.<br>
											<br>
											4. ROBIN, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, MARION: You have a very chauvinistic
											and outdated outlook on life. Your values and principles are defined
											not by clarity of conscience but by popular beliefs. Men: You see
											women as objects and possessions. You demand complete loyalty and
											devotion without offering it in return. Women: You see yourself as
											having only one purpose in life - to satisfy your man. You lack self
											definition as you derive all of who you are from him.<br>
											<br>
											5. ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF: You are a moralist with
											conventional ideas, which some people would call old-fashioned.
											(Men) You probably consider yourself a fair-minded man in a world
											which falls badly below your standards. Your inhibitions and sense
											of guilt are in the way of your happiness. (Women) Unlucky in love?
											Perhaps you hope for too much in a man. Be a realist, not a
											romantic.<br>
											<br>
											6. ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION: You are conventional and
											puritanical. (Men) You moralize and see women as a great conspiracy
											against man, with sex as their principal weapon. You are missing a
											great deal in life. (Women) Your parents probably played a big part
											in the formation of such a guilt complex as yours. Your mind is in
											chains and it's time you did something to free it.<br>
											<br>
											7. LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION: You are not easy to assess.
											Basically you are ruled by an inferiority complex and feelings of
											insecurity. How do you present yourself to the world? An idealist, a
											moralist, a conformist keeping up with the Jones? (Men) Your
											conflicting views on sex and morality may lead to every sort of
											sexual problem. You have always feared women, probably starting with
											your mother. (Women) It is a shame you have not accepted the ideal
											of woman as the equal (and sometimes stronger) partner of man.<br>
											<br>
											8. LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF: You are fairly broadminded
											romantic and reasonably contented. You value kindness greatly and
											try to live by your ideals. You do not conceal from yourself, or
											from others, your strong need for security, which may be either
											emotional or material. (Men) Perhaps you tend to idealize women and
											credit them with virtues they don't possess. (Women) Your
											experiences of men have not all been happy, perhaps because you hope
											for a little too much?<br>
											<br>
											9. LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You are the slightly
											romantic realist. You respect truth, and are broadminded and
											flexible. Whether you are a man or a woman you are probably a happy
											person. You like people and they can readily make friends with you.
											You are not very adventurous, but this does not bother you.<br>
											<br>
											10. LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF: You are a cautious type,
											neutral, and rather insecure. You would agree with the idea that
											everybody has his price - and in your own case it would not be high.
											(Men) You are sexually inhibited with an underlying distrust of
											women. (Women) At least one man has made you unhappy, and you are
											now on your guard.<br>
											<br>
											11. LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN: You too, believe that
											morality is another word for common-sense and suitability, and not
											something which is universally valid or a religious truth. Your
											feeling for security is strong, and you would rate reliability as
											one of your virtues. (Men) Your estimate of women as the inferior
											sex suggests that you are a little uncertain of them. (Women) You
											are more permissive about the morals of others than you are about
											your own.<br>
											<br>
											12. LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION: You are conventional,
											unimaginative, and something of a prude. It would be surprising if
											your love life was a roaring success. (Man) You have an old-world
											authoritarian attitude. One thing is sure - you have some sorry
											illusions about women. (Women) You accept a double standard of
											morality in which women are very much the "second sex".<br>
											<br>
											13. MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN: Associate morality with
											honest and truth more than with religious values. You are impulsive
											and somewhat unpredictable. (Men) We suspect that you are a would-be
											lover rather than a very successful one. (Women) You are a realist
											and a rebel, a defender of women's rights. You like men but despise
											weak ones.<br>
											<br>
											14. MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: Such an emphatic rejection
											of ready-made values in probably partly camouflage. You hate to be
											thought weak or insecure. You value honesty, and abominate humbug
											and hypocrisy. (Men) Women are very much part of you life, and you
											are - or perhaps would like to be - quite ruthless, both with women
											and life in general. (Women) You are tolerant about men and their
											failings - but we mean men, for you have no time for boys on men's
											errands.<br>
											<br>
											15. MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You know the so-called
											facts of life, but not to enjoy life itself. You are not a realist
											and you are inclined to be stubborn. (Men) Women, you think, are
											either whores or angels, and you over-estimate the differences
											between the sexes. A woman may find you difficult to live with.
											(Women) You are not sure whether truth and morality go hand in hand
											or are in opposition. You haven't a very high opinion of men.<br>
											<br>
											16, MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: If you are not happy - and
											we suspect you are not - it maybe because you feel guilty about your
											own emotions, and lack confidence in your opinions. (Men) No doubt
											you consider yourself a moral man, and a fair one. Your fuzzy ideas
											about morality may make their mark on your sex life. (Women) You are
											too concerned about what others think.<br>
											<br>
											17. MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You are essentially a
											contented person, even if you consider yourself a little superior.
											You are moral by your own standards, for you believe that morality
											is what best suits the occasion. (Men) You are sexually uninhibited,
											more romantic than you may appear, and more dependent on the
											approval of others than you care to admit. (Women) You like being a
											woman, you understand what love is, and frankly enjoy sex.<br>
											<br>
											18. MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF: We would expect you to be a
											happy, well-balanced person who likes people and is liked by others.
											You question whether many conventional views on morality are valid
											under all circumstances. (Men) Do we detect a sense of chivalry and
											idealism under the sophistication? (Women) You will expect high
											standards from the men to whom you give your love.<br>
											<br>
											19, SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN: (Man) We find it hard to
											imagine you leading a full, happy life. The warmth and give-and-take
											of love are not for you. Your sex life is ringed with unreality, and
											you neither understand nor appreciate women. (Women) If you really
											believe this is the right order, you baffle us completely.<br>
											<br>
											20, SHERIFF, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, MARION: Although you make a brave
											show of being self-sufficient, beneath this you are unhappy and
											rather mixed up. (Men) You don't understand women - probably you are
											afraid of them. You do not know what love is, and you are more
											likely to boast about your conquests in a bar than prove them in a
											bedroom. (Women) If men attract you at all, they probably be
											disastrously the wrong sort.<br>
											<br>
											21. SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN: If you are not living a
											happy life the cause is within yourself. You are a rebel...with a
											trace of spoilt child about you. You value truth above morality, but
											you are reasonably tolerant of those who disagree with you. (Men)
											any problems you have are not likely to be centered in sex. (Women)
											Despite your experience and intelligence you are a bad judge of
											men.<br>
											<br>
											22. SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: You claim to be a realist
											or even a cynic, but you are more emotional and romantic and
											truthful. (Men) although you are by no means inhibited, your amorous
											adventures are as much a matter of fantasy as fact. (Women) You have
											been hurt in the past by men -or perhaps a particular man and will
											probably let it happen again.<br>
											<br>
											23. SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION: Not a moralizing pattern,
											but...(Men) You share with many other men the idea that most women
											are fickle and inferior to men. Perhaps a view that you got from
											your father? Or as a reaction to a domineering mother? (Women) You
											have a pretty poor opinion of yourself, haven't you?<br>
											<br>
											24. SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN: You have a confused,
											immature sense of values. You are erratic and stubborn, and inclined
											to get angry or sulk when you don't get your own way. But at least
											you are not a moral hypocrite. (Men) "Love 'em and leave 'em" is the
											motto of a man who is basically afraid of women. (Women) Perhaps you
											would rather be a man than a woman?<br>
											<br>

													If a Hammer Is Your Only Tool - Then You Will Treat Every
													Problem has a Nail </strong> </u>
									</center>
									<br><br>
									<p align="justify">
										This is said a lot and I use it a lot, but not sure everyone understands
										it. The short answer is if you only have one way to deal with every
										problem, you will fail more than you succeed. <br><br>

										Knowledge give you options and understanding. Not all problems are the
										same and cannot be fixed the same way. If you don't expand your
										understanding and knowledge of a problem you cannot fix it. <br><br>

										If you don't understand that you created the problem, you will not
										understand to fix or prevent the problem. <br><br>

										If you don't have the ability to see the problem from the horse's point
										of view, then you will not be able to help the horse to see it from its
										point view. <br><br>

										Especially when dealing with kids, animals or horses, you must have the
										ability to understand that they have different experiences in life, have
										different levels of education and learning styles, and NOT one method
										works for everyone or everything. So having many tools, knowledge and
										understanding is essential for you to be able to see the problem
										differently and address it with a various and multitude of solutions.
										NOT just beat it with the same hammer. <br><br>

										So when someone says, if a hammer is your ONLY tool, you will treat
										every problem as a Nail. They are saying to you not seeing the big
										picture. You are being small minded and can't see outside your box of
										information. You are not dealing the problem from the horse's point of
										view but only from YOUR point of view. If you only have a hammer, which
										is used for hitting, then you limit yourself to hitting every problem
										with the your only hammer. <br><br>

										However, if you expand yourself and your knowledge, if you develop
										different tools and different ways of dealing with problems, then you
										become more proficient and are able to deal with different problems in
										better more effective and efficient ways, than to just beat it with a
										hammer. <br><br>

										In horses, small minded, know-it-alls have all the answers. They cannot
										see past their own self inflated ego so they have every horse problems
										by blaming the horse, calling the horse names, showing the horse who is
										boss, through pain fear and intimidation, since that is all their small
										minds can know. <br><br>

										An accomplished horseman, can see the bigger picture. He will see
										problems as HIS failures, his lack of abilities and will find and look
										for ways to make it easier on the horse. He will help the horse grow and
										work through the problem, and not force or blame the horse. He will find
										a DIFFERENT way since he knows that all horses are not the same. He will
										work the problem slower and take more time rather than forcing the issue
										with pain and rushing the horse. He will know he has a hammer but will
										not use it, because he knows there is a better way. He will always be
										trying to grow and enhance his tool box so he will never need to use his
										hammer, because that is better for the horse. There are no horse
										problems, there is only people problems blamed on the horse. <br><br>

										So in short, if you only know, beat the horse, show him who is boss,
										only use bigger bits, whips, spurs and run horses in circles, then you
										only have a hammer, and is what you will use for every problem. <br><br>
										<strong>

											There is never a bad horse born, they are made by people with only a
											hammer in their tool box.</strong>

													The Story of Mr. T, Buddy & Smokey
										</strong></u>
								</center> <br><br>
								<b>
									Buddy is a Quarter horse </b><br>
								Buddy's color is known as a Palomino or Golden Palomino <br>
								Buddy is 63 inches tall<br>
								Dad Sire: Tucker Cash<br>
								Mom Dam: Joanne Jackolina <br>
								Born: May of 2004<br><br>

								Buddy had a bad front tooth from a kick and could not be shown in competitions
								and the owner liked mares over geldings, so she gave him to me because Buddy
								liked me.<br><br>
								<b>
									Mr. T (Montana, Tanner or Big T) </b> <br>
								Mr. T was caught in the Wild from wild herds of Mustangs in Nevada, so he is a
								Mustang<br>
								Color of Mr. T is known as a Seal Brown, when seal are dry look brown when wet
								they look black<br>
								Mr. T is about 63 inches tall<br>
								Born Feb in 1992<br> <br>

								He was caught in Granite Range Nevada, captured by Helicopter and reason for
								captured was listed as Emergency. Mr. T was sold three different times for being
								crazy and un-rideable and to wild to train. In BLM government rules, if a
								Mustang is turned back in to BLM as untamable or untrainable the BLM will kill
								them for being dangerous. Of course with no consideration that the idiot owners
								are the real problem.<br><br>
								<b>
									Smokey Mokie Cat</b><br>
								Smokey Cat was wild kitty that was roaming the woods around the house when I
								moved here in 2013. He looked like he was less than a year old. I started
								feeding him and he stayed around, so I got him fixed and now he lives here.
