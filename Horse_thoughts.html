										<strong><u>The Story of an Oak Tree and a Willow Tree:</u></strong>
										<center>
											<strong></strong>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">In life's travels you can choose to be an a
												strong mighty Oak Tree that is hard, inflexible and will not
												bend or You can also choose to be a flimsy flowing Willow
												Tree that is not rigid at all, it bends and flows in the
												wind so it is not snapped off or up-rooted. The Oak can be
												compared to a strong willed person that is solid, or a proud
												strong horse, the Oak means what he says and stands where it
												stands without changing places just to be popular or
												flexible, sticking to your guns, so to speak. The Willow can
												be compared to a wise person who avoids all conflict, or a
												horse that has been broken and has his sole stolen, they
												never really takes a stand, will go with the flow, will not
												take a position and move with whatever way the wind is
												blowing. Neither way is best all the time. A combination of
												the two works well in life and with horses. Knowing when to
												be which one is the hard part.</p>
											<p align="justify">There are times you should be an Oak, do not
												bend, do not compromise and do not allow the horse any slack
												until he knows you are the leader. In addition, there are
												times when you need to be a flexible and allow yourself to
												bend and change your focus and allow the horse some slack to
												try to make a mistake to earn his trust and show him you can
												be a good leader. The big challenge is knowing when to be
												the Oak and when to be the Willow. No right answer here, no
												book, no checklist, no video, just experience, knowledge,
												hard lessons and sometime, just good luck.</p>
											<p align="justify">If more people thought about this, maybe the
												next time they catch themselves being a strong mighty Oak,
												they would evaluate the situation, look at it from the
												horse's point of view and maybe think it may be a good time
												to change and become a flexible Willow. Maybe cut the horse
												some slack, let the pressure situation calm down, and let
												the rough winds blow by and give yourself and the horse some
												time to relax, so the horse can become a Willow as well.

											<p align="justify">I get many questions about <u>fear</u>. Every
												horse person wants to know how to get fast results with
												little or no effort and they will not take no for an answer.
												In fact, many will spend 10 years or more looking for
												shortcuts rather than investing a year or two in good
												learning and education. The following statement is what
												interferes with people and prevents progress with horses.
												Fast never works out good for the horse, the slow way is the
												fast way.</p>

											<p align="justify">I thought this was right on point. The person
												that did not take pictures thought the camera made the
												pictures nice and gave no credit to the person using the
												camera. The brand or type of stove has nothing to do with
												how the food turns out, it is the Chef that creates,
												prepares, cooks and serves good food.<br>
												<br>
												When people that do not understand horses see a good horse,
												they see the saddle, the bit, or the breed. They do not
												understand that none of that matters, it is how the horse is
												handled and communicated with that makes a good horse.

											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">You will hear it after every barn, "My horse
												is scared of water". This is one of those ridiculous
												statements that make no sense. Horses are not scared of
												water. Horses can be taught to be scared of water by
												insecure owners, or by being protected from water, or by
												being locked up in stalls so they do not know about water,
												or if they were imprinted by humans that are afraid to let
												their horses in water. Horses are NOT scared of water!</p>

											<p></p>
											<hr>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">I can always tell how comfortable someone is
												with a horse by the way they lead a horse or take a picture
												with a horse. Look at most horse pictures of horses and
												people, you will see the handler/owner hanging on the lead
												rope or chain and making the horse keep his head looking at
												the camera. Taking pictures with you holding a lead rope or
												snap or chain so you can get your horse to stand still shows
												a lack of horsemanship and lack of understand. You should be
												able to get your horse's head where you want it - without a
												rope or a chain - <strong>by using feel and
													communication.</strong></p>
											<p></p>
											<hr>
											<p></p>
											<p align="justify">There is a book by Pony boy and in it, I was
												told, he makes the statement: "Horses move men physically
												and they move women emotionally". I think he states his book
												is to women for women. Funny women love this stereotype
												since it sounds pleasant, loving and sweet. However, if I
												point out negative stereotypes and they do not like it, I am
												called a sexist. I guess it is all what you want to see and
												hear. One thing is for sure, if you want women to buy your
												stuff, make it in pink and make it sound nice and lovey
												dovey, you may be an idiot and not know a damn thing about
												what you are selling or what you teaching, but you will sell
												a lot of product. Too bad women cannot see people that play
												to their sense of color and words may be worse for them than
												someone who does not sweet talk or BS them. <strong>I think
													it is better if someone tells you what you need to hear,
													rather than what you want to hear. <i>I know that is
														what a horse wants.</i></strong></p>

											<p align="justify">Find a Horseman and <u>NOT</u> a trainer.
												<strong>Do you know the difference?</strong> Trainers may
												say they have accreditation, awards, certificates, dress the
												part and will tell you they know many great well-known
												horsemen and studied from the best, but what really counts
												is how they handle a horse. What is a good process on how to
												find a good trainer? Too many variables. How do you know if
												he knows or what do you look for? You don't go by what
												others say since they may not know the difference anymore
												than you do. Does s/he get results, style, you do not know
												what too aggressive is or what too nice is. There is No pass
												or fail test, no professional standards in horse training,
												no oversight or review of methods, no safety records, no
												certification process, no license or stamp of approval,
												nothing, just word of mouth and BS words coming from mouths.
												What is a professional? By definition, anyone paid money for
												a job is considered a professional? Really, so if one dummy
												can find another dummy to pay them, they are a professional
												horse trainer. If you do not know the difference from a
												Horseman and horse trainer, then you are cannot effectively
												pick either one. Who is the best person to listen to about

												Meaning you cannot focus on too many things or you will fail
												at all of them. One mind on one thing will give you a better
												chance at success. Yet in horses, I see too many minds in
												new people. They <strong>"try"</strong> and focus on others,
												on clinics they attended, on what they read, on what someone
												told them, on what their trainer is saying, on who is
												watching, on what others are thinking and many other things.
												Too many minds on too many things. One mind on one thing -
												<strong>"The horse".</strong> That is the first step to
												learning and being successful with horses. Too many forget
												to listen to their horse, for the horse is the best teacher

											<p align="justify">Horsemanship is a strange art. It takes
												Consistency and Variety. There are lots of contradictory
												advice and information out there. Some is valid and
												accurate, most is BS and used to make you scared or confuse
												you, some is to make you think horsemanship is too difficult
												for you to know so you need someone else to teach you.
												<i>How do you know the difference?</i> With horses you start
												with consistency to make something routine and to teach the
												horse a habit. Then after you build the horse up and give
												him confidence, you then break up into small steps and
												change things. Remember, <strong>prior learning makes later
													learning easier.</strong> Once a horse learns to learn,
												then learning becomes easier. When you get a horse
												comfortable with change, he expects change and change
												becomes routine. Therefore, habits can be modified or
												changed and the horse expects it and accepts it.

												You will not see a Mare rear like this too often. Normally

												the way boys play, they get rough, they try to learn to be
												dominate. They practice getting strong, learning fighting
												skills and looking big, that way when this is needed later
												in life they will be prepared. This behavior can be used to
												fight off rivals, to scare off predators and to fight for
												their life. People who react this behavior with fear,

												not understand what it is to be a horse. A Horse knows how

										screw up horses and make horses suffer. I say it all the time,
										<strong>"Leave a foal with mom, period."</strong> However, there are
										still all these know nothing horse people that push Human
										Imprinting. Imprinting a horse is a cheat, it is a short cut and a
										way for people to try and rush a relationship with a new born horse.
										IT NEVER WORKS OUT WELL. You will have no problem finding people
										that swear it made their horse perfect and lovable. When someone
										tells you how great imprinting is, ask him or her if they sent their
										horse to a trainer? Imprinting by humans miss valuable lessons a
										horse needs to learn and these lessons cannot be taught by a human.
										The above picture is a prefect example. The horse is NOT being bad
										or mean or disrespectful, however if this baby tired this with a
										human, it would be corrected, confused or taught that it can do this
										to humans and later in life it would hurt a human. <strong>Humans

										rather than having a good and loving relationship with your horse.
										Do not be a "right-fighter" with your horse. It is not about you, it

													Yang)</strong></u><strong></strong>.</a> , an old
										Chinese example of how things work. The outer circle is everything
										and the back and white are opposites, both colors are energy or
										force and they both need each other to become whole and balanced. So
										you can have positive and negative or good and bad, but it
										illustrates an important message in the harmony of life and horses.
										In this picture if you look closely you will notice two horse heads.
										The point to get from this is in all good there is some bad and in
										all bad there is some good. Balance in all things makes it whole.
										Just has no one should only be judged by their worst deed, a horse
										should never be judged by his past or his worst moments. All things
										need from other things, like a child needs a dad and mom, both give
										different things in different things in different ways. Horses need
										a mom and lead stallion to pass on things that they both have.<br>
										<br>
										Time and time again, in species where the males and females are

										In your horsemanship if you look at you and the horse as yin and

										good and bad and when put together you become one, being more
										balanced and whole. Seeing a horse as part of you and you as part of
										the horse will help you develop more feel and will help develop your
										rhythm and timing. You will be able to notice how you affect the
										horse and how the horse affects you. Both, you and the horse, can
										either help the other or hurt the other. The decision is yours. A
										horse is not your slave a horse should be your partner = part of

										became useless and un-needed. There may always be people that own

									<p align="justify"><strong>Beware of horse owners that do not own horse
											trailers.</strong> The signs are clear, people that buy a horse
										with no trailer do not think or plan ahead. They enter horse
										ownership as a hobby, part time or just to try it out, so there no
										need to invest in a trailer yet. They probable cannot afford a
										trailer, which really means they cannot afford a horse. In my
										experience, the people without trailers are the same people that do
										not provide good care to their horses. Not getting things like
										worming medicine, shots, quality hay and other things, and they are
										always looking to borrow a trailer when they need it. This is not
										responsible and normally causes the horse to suffer. When you have
										to depend on others for care of your horse, you put your horse in a
										position to depend on others for its care.</p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>Never lend your horse trailer out.</strong>
										This is one of those lessons that normally has to be learned the
										hard way since most people want to help and be nice. I have seen
										time and time again when trailers are borrowed they are broke.
										People that do not own trailers do not normally pull trailers, so
										the odds of them messing up or having an accident are high. Things
										like cutting short on a turn can pinch a tire and weaken the
										sidewall so it may not go flat now but can blow out later. Hitting a
										curb can bend an axle or cause misalignment with will make your
										tires wear bad and will make the ride rougher. Many things to go
										wrong and I assure you if the people do not own a trailer and are
										borrow yours, you can bet they will not buy you a new trailer if
										they wreck yours and will not have the money to fix yours.
										<i>"Neither a borrower or a lender"</i> is very wise advice with
										most things and especially with horse people.

										horse now and then. This has to be worked at constantly and must not
										be forgotten. The horse tells us so much about so many things, but
										as stupid humans, we are always too busy, too smart and too stupid
										to step back, look and listen to our horse. This is such a critical
										error in horsemanship. A horse will tell you to slow down, that he
										is confused, that he is trying, that he is not understanding, that
										he needs help, that he is not ready and many other things,

									<h3><strong>Doing the Opposite of What Seems Normal</strong></h3>
									<p></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>I often say this a lot in Horsemanship -
											doing the opposite of what you think is right. Our training,
											life experiences, knowledge, understanding and learned skills
											may tell us to do things a certain way. These things can be
											right sometime and may be wrong sometime. Others may see what we
											are doing as odd or not making sense. Since we are predators and
											a horse is prey, we are opposite in many ways, so some time
											doing the opposite of we think is right, works out better for
											the horse.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>We recently had some fires in my area and it
											reminded me of a story. Two men found themselves trapped on a
											hillside and surrounding by a raging fire rapidly catching up
											with them. They were running and running but the fire was
											gaining on them and it looked as if they were not going to make
											it and would be burned alive. The older of two suddenly stopped
											running, pulled out his lighter, knelled down and started
											lighting the grass on fire. The younger of the two could not
											understand what this guy was doing and left him and kept
											running. The older guy lived and younger guy died? Why? You see
											if you had any fire training and were older and wiser, you would
											know that when a fire is coming it needs fuel to burn. By
											lighting the grass around him he burnt up the fuel and gave
											himself a place to lay down, that was already burnt, with no
											fuel, so when the fire caught up to him, it would not have fuel
											and would burn the fuel around him and pass over him. This is
											what happened in this case. The man lay down and covered up with
											a fire blanket over the burnt area with no fuel and the fire
											passed him. His younger friend was not so lucky, he was over
											come by exhaustion, fell in the grass, in the fuel and the fire
											burnt him and the fuel he laid on.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>So from the outside many would say only a
											fool would stop and light a fire when running from and trying to
											escape a wild fire. When in fact, doing the opposite of what
											seemed dumb, is what saved his life.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>In many areas with horses, when you, as a
											predator, think you should pull, you should actually release.
											When you think you should rush over and help, you should stay
											out of it and not interfere or add pressure to the horse. When
											your instinct tells you to pull on the reins to try and stop a
											running horse, you should actually relax the reins and just
											ride. When your emotion tells you that your poor horse has been
											abused and you think you should be extra nice, you should
											actually be extra clear and strong with your leadership. When a
											horse pulls or rears and your instinct is to pull back, you
											should actually not pull and move to horse's butt. When a horse
											tries to run off you will want to grab the rope tighter and
											think you can stop him, which will get you a nice deep rub burn.
											An experienced horseman will not squeeze the rope and will let
											it run through his hands, knowing he cannot stop the horse by
											grabbing tighter. Many things in horses is learning NOT to
											follow your predator instinctive reactions and to know how and
											what the horse is seeing and feeling and to react like a higher
											horse would and NOT like a human predator would.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>Learning this can take many years, time,
											effort and listening to many horses. It is easy to see when
											someone knows this since the horse appears to understand,
											connect, and cooperate with the handler. Of course many will see
											this understanding and communication as a gift or special sense
											or some secret horse whisperer wisdom, when in fact it is
											nothing more that someone who understands horses and has trained
											his reactions to work with and understand the horse with timing
											and feel, rather than to blame the horse for his
											failures.</strong></p>
									<p align="justify"><strong>So when you see someone making a mistake with
											a horse, think, what would have happened if the person had done
											the opposite of what they did? If you take care of and learn
											your horsemanship, your horsemanship will take care of you and
											your horse. When you get better Your horse gets better.</strong>

										<strong><u><strong>Let's discuss FEAR:</strong></u></strong>
									</center><strong><u></u></strong><u><br>
										<br></u>
									<p align="justify">This is perhaps the biggest inhibitor to human and
										horse relationship. Both feel fear, both know fear, both react to
										fear but both fears are very different. A human is scared to be out
										of control, scared to get hurt or scared of what might happen, or
										what will hurt them. This is nowhere near the high-level fear of
										what a horse feels. A horse's fear is about life or death. A horse
										wants to live and all their fear is to survive. This is why their
										response to fear is much stronger than humans are. A horse is born
										to live, survive, and run. They do not care about what might happen,
										they don't care if they may get hurt, they instinctively run from
										fear to stay alive.</p>
									<p align="justify"> So when humans react to fear with aggression or
										retreat or confusion or frustration, the horse only reacts to fear
										to flee and stay alive. This is so misunderstood and it creates so
										many problems for most horse people. It amazes me that people want
										and expect a horse to deal and control their fear of dying, yet most
										humans cannot control their fear of getting hurt. Unfair and
										unreasonable, but only the human has choices, the horse never gets a
										choice. They are stuck with the person they are with and they have
										no choice for any situation they are forced into by a scared or
										unknowing human.</p>
									<p align="justify"><u></u></p>
									<center>
										<u><strong>A fish does not know he is wet, just a like a horse does
												not know he is safe, is the absence of fear the same as
												safety?</strong></u>
									</center><u><strong></strong><br>
										<br></u>
									<p align="justify">Cut your horse some slack. They get scared, they
										react, they want to stay alive, (stupid horse) until you can control
										your fear 100 percent, do not expect or ask your horse to do it.
										Stop and think like a horse, stop and see things from a horse's
										perspective not a human perspective. Understand what strong
										instinctual forces drive the horse's fear and help him work through
										it, learn to control it and don't contribute to it or make it worse.
										<strong>The best gift you can give to your horse is understanding of
											the horse.</strong>
									</p>
									<p align="justify">The next time you get upset or frustrated with your
										horse's fear, just think if your horse treated you the same you
										treat him when you get scared. You get what you give, would you like
										your horse to cause pain, pull your hair, pull on a pain bit, hit
										you or scream at you every time you got scared. I doubt it. If you
										understand the horse then you can treat the horse the way you would
										want to be treated, if you were a horse.</p><u></u>
									<hr>
									<p align="justify"><u></u></p>
									<center>
										<u><strong>How does a horse show FEAR?</strong></u>
									</center>
									<p></p>
									<p align="justify">Let me count the ways. A horse shows fear is so many
										ways, some very subtle and some not so subtle or a combination of
										both.</p>
									<p align="justify">Horse fear = ear position, head position, head high,
										tense body, bracing, balking, stalling, tail position, tense tail,
										flashy tail, eyes open wide, nostrils flaring, breathing increase,
										chewing stops, ignores other things, stares, hyper vigilant, blows
										hard, snorts, calls out, backs up, tries to flee or run, rears,
										moves his feet, fights being restrained, feels trapped, attempts to
										move to open areas, tail activity increases, shows resistance, stops
										listening due to focusing on fear and many other things. Yet people
										still say, how do you know when you horse is scared. If you do not
										know how to listen or read your horse, then you will always be
										guessing. Some time you will guess right some time you will guess
										wrong, that will only show the horse you do not know what you are
										doing and he should not trust you and you are not a good confident
										leader and that will only increase the horse's fear and anxiety,
										which will increase his reactions to fear and will increase your
										fear and the cycle continues and escalates. Only you have the power
										to make it worse or make it better.</p>
									<p align="justify">Don't forget when a horse imagines fear, to the horse
										it is the same as real fear. No difference to the horse, they do not
										know the difference. If a horse perceives a plastic bag is a wolf
										that wants to eat him, to the horse it is a wolf, it does not matter
										that YOU know it is only a plastic bag. It then becomes your job to
										help the horse learn and understand it is not a wolf and only a
										plastic bag. You cannot lower a horse's fear with pain or force.
										Remember that, <strong>PAIN never lowers a horse's fear, it
											increases it.</strong> A little fact that most people can't seem
										to get. Far too often stupid humans forget the push pull
										polarization of a predator and a prey. Humans must learn to think
										and be like a prey, it is impossible for a prey to understand and
										become or be like a predator. The smarter of the two must come down
										to the lower of the two. Too often it is hard to tell who is really
										smarter.</p>

									<p align="justify"><strong>Critical Eye Reminder:</strong></p>
									<p align="justify">Always remember to use your critical eye. Look at
										things deeper, from different angles; be suspicious and more suspect
										when dealing with horse people. This picture was in a tack store.
										Notice the chain on the halter, notice it says Sweet Disposition and
										then has <u>NOT</u> underlined a child's horse, needs intermediate
										rider? ? What is really being said? I do not know the horse or owner
										but I would say, this horse is not handled well, not exposed to
										much, kept away from kids or maybe teased by kids and the owners
										could be either worried or scared of this horse.</p><br>
									<p><img align="left" border="2"
											height="420 /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="
											src="images/horse&#32;for&#32;sale.jpg" width="280"> KEY words
										should raise red flags to those who pay attention. Unfortunately,
										most people buying this horse will only see how well groomed it is,
										how pretty it is and will hear "Sweet Disposition" so it must be
										loving. Most people think they are better riders than they are, so
										no one considers themselves a beginner rider so they are either
										intermediate or advanced, so this horse would be perfect??? So the
										horse will be sold to someone who can't handle it, won't know what
										to expect and then will be labeled wild, dangerous or out of control
										and then re-sold to someone who is an inexperienced buyer only to be
										taught more bad lessons by more stupid humans and will told by the
										horse that they are not as good as they think they are, but the
										horse will get blamed and will likely be destined to be re-sold
										several times. Could this add just be a perfect add for a great
										horse owned by great and honest owners? It could be, but in my
										experience, not likely. If you are critical and do more research,
										ask more questions, verify what is being said and prove your
										suspicions wrong, then you are being smarter and better prepared. Or
										you can just think everyone is nice and good, no would every lie and
										buy the this horse after reading the add? Either way, the horse has
										no options and no control over his future.</p>
									<p align="justify">I posted this and got comments saying the chain was
										just wrapped around the halter and was not hurting the horse. Here
										was my response to that uneducated eye: I don't care if the chain is
										lined with pink feathers, chains and horses are bad, chains cause
										pain, chains are used to intimidate or create fear to the horse, if
										you think that chain is just looped and is not used to pop, control
										or make sure the horse knows the chain is there and can be used,
										then you are missing the point and living in lala land. You are the
										blind man searching for the man with one eye. Grab the first blind
										man you see and ask him to lead you out of the burning building.
										Stop making excuses for people's ignorance, cruel techniques, dumb
										gimmicks and pain devices.</p>
									<p align="justify">I took down the Facebook page, too many negative
										women coming over, complaining, blaming and creating drama. Got
										tired of dealing with it and of course women won't correct rude
										petty bully women since they don't want to be the focus of their
										meanness, so it continues and gets worse and since if a man calls a
										woman out for it, he is just a sexist.</p>
									<p align="justify">Pretty horses are cursed to be owned by people that
										think looks equals good well-trained horse. Too bad for the pretty
										horses and pretty ponies, they are set up to fail for their beauty.
										This horse is very nice looking, that is all you can tell from a
										picture, but the words are warning you if you want to see it or hear
										it.</p>

										<strong><u>Illusion of Control:</u></strong>
									</center>
									<p></p>
									<p align="justify">I talk about a movie called <a
											href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128278/"
											target="_blank"><strong>Instinct,</strong></a> where Anthony
										Hopkins lives with Gorillas and he is accepted into their herd and
										he talks about some very interesting concepts. A group of Gorillas
										are known as a band or troop, I think it is similar to horse herds,
										they have a hierarchy and pecking order, the males leave and the
										females tend to stay, they move together and take leadership from
										the Silverback (lead male), herd leader. In this movie the three
										things I think mirror or apply to horses are as follows -</p>
									<p align="justify">1) The lead Gorilla watches over his troop. He
										decides where to go for food and water and he controls the band.
										Anthony Hopkins is accepted into the herd, after the Silverback
										makes it clear that he is submissive to his leadership and authority
										and then watches over him. At one point in the movie Anthony said,
										It is an amazing feeling to be watched over. Unless you spend time
										in a herd and get accepted as part of or leader of a horse herd, you
										may not understand this, but once you have been accepted into a herd
										of horses, you can fully understand the impact of this statement
										about being watched over or protected.</p>
									<p align="justify">2) At another point he talks about "Takers". This is
										explained in the movie, but the short answer is those humans that
										take from everything they touch and never give back. Basically
										taking whatever they want regardless of the harm or negative
										consequences. The horse world has far too many "Takers". And since
										there is so much ignorance in the horse world, it makes it that much
										easier to take from the scared or fearful.</p>
									<p align="justify">3) And finally, in one part of the movie the concept
										of <strong>"Illusion of control"</strong> is discussed or is taught.
										This is how stupid humans think they are smarter and always in
										control, when in reality, they are never really in control, but they
										convince themselves that they are in control. This happens with many
										horse people. They think a bit stops a horse. <i>"Illusion of
											control".</i> They think they are smarter than horses.
										<i>"Illusion of control".</i> They think they can treat a horse
										however they want and it won't fight back or they think they can
										control a horse with force, fear and pain, both beliefs are
										dangerous <i>"Illusions of control".</i>
									</p>
									<p align="justify">The movie makes the topics clear and if you get a
										chance, take a look, it is a good movie with a good message and it
										just might teach you something about yourself, stupid humans and
										give you something you can apply to your horsemanship.</p>

									<p align="justify"></p>
									<center>
										<img border="0" height="300" src="images/red&#32;ribbon.jpg" width="300">
									</center>
									<p></p>
									<p align="justify">The cartoon is funny, but not knowing some things can
										get you hurt or killed around horses. Like knowing how a horse's
										vision works and where its blind spots are. Knowing that different
										horses are different learning experiences, so not all horses are the
										same and not all horses react the same. Knowing that being around a
										horse can be dangerous or safe, it is up to you. It is your
										responsibility to know what might happen before you blindly go
										around a strange horse. Helping, getting involved or handling
										unknown horses can get you hurt pretty damn fast and normally when
										that happens, the horse is blamed. Developing that critical eye and
										ear, never accepting anything for fact unless you prove it yourself,
										always understanding that horse are make to act bad or dangerous so
										never treat or approach a horse like YOU know what you are doing so
										nothing can wrong.</p>
									<p align="justify">This cartoon plays on the ignorance of the little
										girl, but it does not show the seriousness of this topic. It still
										amazes me how many people want to warn people, hey that horse will
										kick, hey be careful that horse will bite, watch out that horse will
										rear. Really, you feel the need to warn people of these things.
										Anyone around a horse that does not know this is a fool. Why don't
										people warn people, hey watch out that horse will eat and poop or
										watch out that can run???? The people warning foolish things are
										just as foolish as the people needing to be warned.</p>
									<p></p>
									<center>
										PS: A red ribbon tied to a horse's tail is a warning to others that
										the horse is known to kick, so be aware and stay clear of kicking
										range. Some people do this since they get nervous on trail rides
										when other horses get close so this keeps horses at a distance, but
										the fact is the horse has never kicked. <i>*Remember: believe
											nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see.</i>
									</center>
									<p></p>
									<p align="justify">I am a big "Mind your own business". Let people be
										responsible for their actions. If you run over and try to warn or
										get involved, you may end up spooking the horse or causing what you
										are trying to prevent. So if you feel the need to get involved, you
										better be ready to get blamed and be responsible for what happens
										since you have a greater chance of causing problems then preventing
										them.</p>
									<p align="justify">So when do you get involved? The short answer is
										never. The long answer is "almost never."</p>

										<h3><strong>Stop Nagging your Horse:</strong></h3>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Here is my take on this article and how it
											relates to understanding horses and understanding that what we
											do causes our horse to do what they do.</p>
										<p align="justify">An article that I found interesting was posted in
											the Wall Street Journal. Below are quotes from article about
											nagging.</p>
										<div class="indented">
											<p align="justify">"Experts say it is exactly the type of toxic
												communication that can eventually sink a relationship.
												Nagging the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes
												a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both
												become increasingly annoyed."</p>
										</div>
										<p align="justify">The above statement describes so many horse
											trainers and horse owners. People continue to do the same thing
											over and over and never seem to realize that what they keep
											repeating is NOT working and that they need to change what they
											are doing. So the horse gets more confused, learns to accept the
											nagging and asking as something that they just need to ignore or
											resist. The horse learns to adjust and ignore. Then the horse
											gets label as mean, lazy, bad, stupid or does not listen.</p>
										<div class="indented">
											<p align="justify">"Why do we nag? "We have a perception that we
												won't get what we want from the other person, so we feel we
												need to keep asking in order to get it," says Scott Wetzler,
												a psychologist and vice chairman of the Department of
												Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical
												Center in New York. It is a vicious circle: The naggee tires
												of the badgering and starts to withhold, which makes the
												nagger nag more."</p>
										</div>
										<p align="justify">The key to the above statements are nagging is a
											result of frustration, confusing and not getting what you want.
											How many horse owners does that apply to? Even if it does not
											work, the human continues to nag. Just like the horse when it is
											confused, scared, nervous, cornered or frustrated, the HORSE
											continues to resist, does not give the right answer and goes
											back to its instincts or flight, fear and fight. Neither grows
											or finds comfort, yet the majority of people continue to do what
											they do and horse continues to do what they do. Unless you can
											understand the horse has no choice and only knows how to be a
											horse, you will never develop a good trusting relationship with
											your horse.</p>
										<div class="indented">
											<p align="justify">"An extremely organized, obsessive or anxious
												person may not be able to refrain from giving reminders,
												especially if the partner is laid back and often does things
												at the last minute. Other people are naturally resistant
												some might say lazy and could bring out the nagger in
												anyone."</p>
										</div>
										<p align="justify">The above statement again points to YOU the
											human. If you are going to be around horses you must be more
											aware, you must be alert and ready to engage, act and react. You
											must be ready to give direction or re-direct the horse so to
											defuse the horse's natural instincts to run and flee. If you do
											this with timing, feel and rhythm then your horse will feel safe
											and comfortable and will look to you for guidance and assurance
											rather than see you as a fearful confused predator that hinders
											the horse rather than helps the horse. The horse is a mirror; it
											reflects back what it gets. If it gets good it gives good, if it
											gets bad, confusion, fear, or insecurity, then that is what it
											gives back.</p>
										<div class="indented">
											<p align="justify">"But women are more likely to nag, experts
												say, The problem is that by asking repeatedly, they make
												things worse. "Nagging is an enemy of love, if allowed to
												persist," Dr. Markman says. As long as I am not putting
												pressure on him, he seems to respond better. "There's no
												annoying tone of voice or body posture. It's all out of the
												equation." The first step in curbing the nagging cycle,
												experts say, is to admit that you are stuck in a bad
												pattern. You are fighting about fighting. You need to work
												to understand what makes the other person tick". I don't
												take it personally when he doesn't respond." "There is a
												sense of recognition about what's happening," Mr. Egurbide
												says. "It's easier to accommodate each other.""</p>
										</div>
										<p align="justify">In the above statement the language is so horse
											specific, it is funny. The woman above learns that nagging does
											not work and that when she changes what she does, she gets
											different and more desirable results. Amazing, when she changed
											and gave different messages, the answers also changed.
											Brilliant, that is exactly what horse owners need to realize.
											Every failure of your horse is your failure. Every wrong answer
											you get is a result of the wrong way to ask. Every bad thing
											your horse does is a result of YOU doing something in a bad or
											confusing way. A horse would always rather to avoid conflict and
											discomfort. However, the horse has to be shown the right way to
											avoid the pressure or discomfort. When people learn this, they
											will immediate progress in their horse. Which is why when you,
											the stupid human gets better, that is when your horse gets
											better.</p>

													<br>
													It's More Common Than Adultery and Potentially As Toxic,
													So Why Is It So Hard to Stop Nagging?</strong><br>
												<br>
												By ELIZABETH BERNSTEIN (Reprinted from Wall Street Journal
												Jan 2012)<br>
												<br>
												Ken Mac Dougall bit into the sandwich his wife had packed
												him for lunch and noticed something odd a Post-it note
												tucked between the ham and the cheese. He pulled it out of
												his mouth, smoothed the crinkles and read what his wife had
												written: "Be in aisle 10 of Home Depot tonight at 6 p.m."
												Marriage counselors warn that nagging is one of the leading
												causes for discord and divorce, Elizabeth Bernstein reports
												on Lunch Break.<br>
												<br>
												Mr. Mac Dougall was renovating the couple's Oak Ridge, N.J.,
												kitchen, and his wife had been urging him to pick out the
												floor tiles. He felt he had plenty of time to do this task.
												She felt unheard.<br>
												<br>
												"I thought the note was an ingenious and hysterical way to
												get his attention," says his wife, Janet Pfeiffer (whose
												occupation, interestingly enough, is a motivational
												speaker), recalling the incident which occurred several
												years ago. Her husband, a technician at a company that
												modifies vehicles for handicapped drivers, did not really
												see it that way. "I don't need a reminder in the middle of
												my sandwich," he says.<br>
												<br>
												Nagging <strong>the interaction in which one person
													repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly
													ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed
												</strong>is an issue every couple will grapple with at some
												point. While the word itself can provoke chuckles and eye
												rolling, the dynamic can potentially be as dangerous to a
												marriage as adultery or bad finances. Experts say it is
												exactly the type of <strong>toxic communication that can
													eventually sink a relationship.</strong><br>
												<br>
												Why do we nag? "We have a perception that we won't get what
												we want from the other person, so we feel we need to keep
												asking in order to get it," says Scott Wetzler, a
												psychologist and vice chairman of the Department of
												Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical
												Center in New York. <strong>It is a vicious circle: The
													naggee tires of the badgering and starts to withhold,
													which makes the nagger nag more.</strong><br>
												<br>
												Personality contributes to the dynamic, Dr. Wetzler says. An
												extremely organized, <strong>obsessive or anxious
													person</strong> may not be able to refrain from giving
												reminders, especially if the partner is laid back and often
												does things at the last minute. Other people are naturally
												resistant some might say lazy and could bring out the nagger
												in anyone.<br>
												<br>
												It is possible for husbands to nag, and wives to resent them
												for nagging. <strong><u>But women are more likely to nag,
														experts say,</u></strong><u></u> largely because
												they are conditioned to feel more responsible for managing
												home and family life. In addition, they tend to be more
												sensitive to early signs of problems in a relationship. When
												women ask for something and do not get a response, they are
												quicker to realize something is wrong. <u>The problem is
													that by asking repeatedly, they make things
													worse.</u><br>
												<br>
												Men are to blame, too, because they do not always give a
												clear answer. Sure, a husband might tune his wife out
												because he is annoyed; nagging can make him feel like a
												little boy being scolded by his mother. But many times he
												doesn't respond because he doesn't know the answer yet, or
												he knows the answer will disappoint her.<br>
												<br>
												Nagging can become a prime contributor to divorce when
												couples start fighting about the nagging rather than talking
												about the issue at the root of the nagging, say Howard
												Markman, professor of psychology at the University of Denver
												and co-director of the Center for Marital and Family
												Studies. For 30 years, Dr. Markman has researched conflict
												and communication in relationships and offered relationship
												counseling and marriage seminars. He says that while all
												couples deal with nagging at some point, those who learn to
												reduce this type of negative communication will
												substantially increase their odds of staying together and
												keeping love alive. Couples who don't learn often fall out
												of love and split up.<br>
												<br>
												Research that Dr. Markman published in 2010 in the Journal
												of Family Psychology indicates that couples who became
												unhappy five years into their marriage had a roughly 20%
												increase in negative communication patterns consistent with
												nagging, and a 12% decrease in positive communication.
												"Nagging is an enemy of love, if allowed to persist," Dr.
												Markman says.<br>
												<br>
												The good news: Couples can learn to stop nagging. Early in
												their marriage, Ms. Pfeiffer, now 62, repeatedly reminded
												her husband about household tasks and became more demanding
												when he ignored her. "If I was asking him to take care of
												something that mattered to me and he was blowing me off,
												that made me feel like I didn't matter," she says.<br>
												<br>
												Mr. Mac Dougall, 58, says the nagging made his muscles
												tense, he would become silent and his eyes would glaze over
												in a "thousand-yard stare." "Her requests conveyed some sort
												of urgency that I didn't think was needed," he says. "If I
												said I was going to get to it, I would definitely get to
												it."<br>
												<br>
												Ms. Pfeiffer decided to <strong>soften her approach. She
													asked herself, "How can I speak in a way that is not
													threatening or offensive to him?"</strong> She began
												writing requests on Post-it notes, adding little smiley
												faces or hearts. Mr. Mac Dougall says he was initially
												peeved about the sandwich note but did show up at Home Depot
												that evening smiling. Ms. Pfeiffer sometimes writes notes to
												him from the appliances that need to be fixed. "I really
												need your help," a recent plea began. "I am really backed up
												and in a lot of discomfort." It was signed "your faithful
												bathtub drain." "As long as I am not putting pressure on
												him, he seems to respond better," Ms. Pfeiffer says. Mr. Mac
												Dougall agrees. "The notes distract me from the face-to-face
												interaction," he says. "There's no annoying tone of voice or
												body posture. It's all out of the equation."<br>
												<br>
												The first step in curbing the nagging cycle, experts say, is
												to <u><strong>admit that you are stuck in a bad
														pattern.</strong></u> You are fighting about
												fighting. You need to work to understand what makes the
												other person tick. Rather than lazy and unloving, is your
												husband overworked and tired? Is your wife really suggesting
												she doesn't trust you? Or is she just trying to keep track
												of too many chores?<br>
												<br>
												Noreen Egurbide, 44, of Westlake Village, Calif., says she
												used to give her husband frequent reminders to take out the
												garbage, get the car serviced or pick up the kids from
												school. "I thought I was helping him," she says. Jose
												Egurbide, 47, often waited a while before doing what she
												asked. The couple would argue. Sometimes Ms. Egurbide would
												just do it herself.<br>
												<br>
												A few years ago, they got insight into their nagging problem
												after taking a problem-solving assessment test, the Kolbe
												Assessment. Ms. Egurbide, a business coach, learned she is a
												strategic planner who gathers facts and organizes in
												advance. Her husband, an attorney, learned that he is
												resistant to being boxed into a plan. Now, Ms. Egurbide
												says, <u><strong>"I don't take it personally when he doesn't
														respond." "There is a sense of recognition about
														what's happening," Mr. Egurbide says. "It's easier
														to accommodate each
														other."</strong></u><strong></strong>

										<p align="justify">To me this is a really good example of emotional
											perception and physical reality. Women that do not have a baby
											will relate to the top peaceful loving picture and women that
											have had children will understand the lower picture as
											realistic. Of course both pictures are correct and both may
											happen, but neither is absolute or will happen all the time.</p>
										<p align="justify">Much like in horses, many see their horse
											relationship as calm, loving, peaceful and harmony, yet in
											reality they have no concept of what it takes to achieve that
											type of relationship. A person who thinks breeding is important
											will find beauty in a horse with papers. A person that loves
											Thoroughbreds will find good in them, just like a person who
											does not like Arabs will find fault with them.</p>
										<p align="justify">A horse is a horse and that is all they know.
											Seeing things in them will not change them or make what you see
											true. Loving a horse will not create a bond or trust. Believing
											your horse loves you will not make the horse better or more
											trustworthy.</p>
										<p align="justify"><strong>There are none so blind as those who are
												unwilling to see.</strong> Breaking down our belief system
											is very difficult and does not happen easily. There are many
											strong and perpetuated beliefs in the horse world. Most are very
											wrong and hurt the horse. However, trying to undo this
											bombardment of ignorance is an uphill battle and many will fight
											to be right and refuse to hear another way. I say it often but
											it is still rare in the horse world, the best gift you can give

											<strong><u>Why Slow is Faster with Horses:</u></strong>
										</center><strong><u></u></strong><u></u>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">You may have heard, and I say this as well, the
											slow way is the fast way with horses. However, what does that
											really mean? Going slow with progression is good, but not so
											slow that learning is lost. A horse can be challenged or can be
											bored. A horse can learn that there is a right answer so it will
											look for it and try and find it or it can learn that I just get
											harassed and pushed and there is no right answer or I can't find
											the right answer so I will stop trying to find a right answer.
											Obviously, you want the first and not the latter.</p>
										<p align="justify">Speed of how fast a horse learns depends on many
											factors. Things like experience of the person, experience of the
											horse, knowledge of the person teaching, understanding of how to
											read a horse, how to talk to a horse, timing and when to give
											pressure and when to give release, smooth rhythm to work with
											the horse and not against the horse, understanding of how to
											know if the horse is confused, frustrated, bored, inattentive or
											if the horse is being disrespectful or resistant or if the horse
											is trying. All of these factors will either help the horse learn
											faster or prevent the horse from learning or will teach the
											horse the wrong lesson.</p>
										<p align="justify"></p>
										<center>
											<b><u>Secret Tip:</u></b><u></u> If you act like you have all
											day it will only take minutes. If you act like you only have
											minutes to teach something, it will take all day.
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">So how do you know all this? -- Time, experience,
											patience, understanding of the horse and pay attention and
											listen to the horse. Of course, you may think you are paying
											attention and you may think you understand what the horse is
											saying and you may be wrong. This is why horsemanship is not as
											easy as it looks. Yet on every bookshelf or every video for sale
											or every special training equipment for sale, you will be told
											there are shortcuts or special secrets to get all the answers
											quick and fast. No right answers, no special fix, no secret
											trick or gimmick.</p>
										<p align="justify">So has this answered the question or made you
											think of more questions? Bottom line - Learn to understand the
											horse, learn to listen and learn from the horse, then all things
											become easier.</p>

											ownership is a long time commitment, horses need time and
											understanding, trust your horse (fear is NOT trust), a horse is
											completely dependent on you and it is your responsibility, a
											horse can fight back very good so you don't want to make it do
											that, horses can't tell you when they are in pain or don't feel
											well - Pay Attention, realize a horse gets old and things like
											sight, health, pain and abilities get old as well, and last but
											not least, anyone can buy or own a horse, but it takes a great

											"Teach" the horse their stupid way instead of the horse way.

											certifications, licensing, sellers, buyers, traders, drugs,
											care; so horses are on their own and have little or no

													Horse" should only be judged from the standard of a
													horse. Humans judge things from their perspective. Many
													see a horse as a pet like a dog or cat. A dog or cat is
													very different from a horse. The biggest difference I
													see is the <strong>"FEAR."</strong> A dog or cat cannot
													kill you by accident and they cannot cripple you for
													life. The large size, strength and gentleness of horses
													draw people to them, and these same things push or keep
													people at a distance. The horse sees this fear as
													confusion, weakness or lack of leadership and trust. A
													phenomenon many people experience.<br>
													<br>
													Horses can run, jump, survive in the wild, raise their
													young and thrive in the wild without human involvement.
													They are exceptional at living in a herd, protecting
													their young and being horses. <strong>It is only when
														humans get involved and tries to improve or teach a
														horse to be domesticated, that the horse
														fails.</strong> It is only when the humans try to
													teach horses better that they suffer and fail.
													<strong>The success of the horse is unchallenged as long
														as humans stay out of it.</strong> If I were to
													judge a human compared to a horse, the human would fail
													every time. A human cannot run as fast a horse, cannot
													jump as far, cannot communicate as well as the horse,
													cannot smell as good as a horse, cannot hear as good,
													cannot work as hard, cannot pull or carry as much and
													cannot be as forgiving as the horse. I think humans know
													that horses are better, which is why humans are so
													attracted to horses, since opposites attract and people
													seek in others what they lack themselves. Weak people
													tend to have strong friends or partners, sometime to the
													extreme. I have been known to say <strong>"Horse people
														have issues."</strong> Many people write me and
													agree with that, but most all think they are exception
													to this rule. People that collect horses normally have
													more issues, RE: the "Buck Movie" lady.<br>
													<br>
													I digress; the point of this is to remind people that
													horses are fine without us. Horses only fail with the
													help of humans. Lastly, when judging a horse as right or
													wrong, or good or bad, remember <strong>"Your horse is
														only a horse and that is all it knows how to
														be."</strong></u></strong></p>

										<p align="justify">Nice picture and sounds nice. This is a
											subliminal message that wants to appeal to the emotional love of
											a horse, yet it adds some fear reality. When you buy a car, do
											they say it rides great but you it can blow up and burn in a
											crash? Only in horses do people look at their beauty and grace
											and fail to see them for what they are. A horse is only a horse
											and that is all it knows how to be. A lady wrote me and asked me
											how make her horse safe, since she did not want to hurt. I told
											her if she wants safe, she needs to play checkers. Horses are
											large, 1200 pound of pure muscle, bone and fear reactions, so if
											you want something to sit on your lap and love you, a horse is
											should not be your first choice. Horses are great but they are
											not on the short list of safe things, especially when fear is
											involved.<br>
											<br>
											I have yet to meet a fearful horse that did not have a fearful
											rider. A horse is a reflection, it gives what it gets, it does
											not care about right or wrong, it seeks comfort and avoids
											pressure. Too often people want to make a horse what they want
											them to be or what they think it should be. Seeing a horse as
											anything but a horse, sets you and the horse up to fail.
											Horsemanship is not a success only journey

											horse. Anytime a horse is moved there are many stresses that are
											put on the horse. Things like change in food, water, environment
											and other things. When a horse is stressed, it changes his
											systems, he is more prone to colic, his immune system is

											<strong>The Story of the Snake and the Rabbit:</strong>
										</center>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Once there was this rabbit and snake that met at
											the edge of the river. Both needed to get across to the other
											side. Since the snake could not swim, he asked the rabbit if he
											would let him ride on his back to get across the river.<br>
											<br>
											The rabbit said no way, I know what you are up to, you want to
											get on my back so you can bite me. The protested and said he
											would not bite him since if he bit him, they would both drown.
											The rabbit thought about it and agreed to carry the snake across
											the river.<br>
											<br>
											The snake got on the rabbits back and the rabbit started
											swimming across the river. As they got to the middle of the
											river, the snake bit the rabbit.<br>
											<br>
											The rabbit was shocked and confused and asked the snake, why did
											you bite me, now we both are going to die. The snake replied, "I
											can't help it, it is my nature."<br>
											<br>
											It is a horse's nature to be fearful and careful. It does not
											trust new things because their instinct says stay alive be ready
											to run and do not be cornered or trapped. Almost all things we
											do to a horse is against its nature, so have patience and
											understanding. Realize and accept that the horse is not being
											mean or stupid, it is being a horse and that is its nature.

											<strong>Horses respond better to the Sheepdog, fears the wolf

										<center>
											<strong>On Sheep, Wolves, and Sheepdogs - Dave Grossman<br>
												By LTC (RET) Dave Grossman, author of "On Killing."</strong>
										</center><strong></strong>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify">Honor never grows old, and honor rejoices the
											heart of age. It does so because honor is, finally, about
											defending those noble and worthy things that deserve defending,
											even if it comes at a high cost. In our time, that may mean
											social disapproval, public scorn, hardship, persecution, or as
											always, even death itself. The question remains: What is worth
											defending? What is worth dying for? What is worth living for? -
											William J. Bennett - in a lecture to the United States Naval
											Academy November 24, 1997.<br>
											<br>
											One Vietnam veteran, an old retired colonel, once said this to
											me: "Most of the people in our society are sheep. They are kind,
											gentle, productive creatures who can only hurt one another by
											accident." This is true. Remember, the murder rate is six per
											100,000 per year, and the aggravated assault rate is four per
											1,000 per year. What this means is that the vast majority of
											Americans are not inclined to hurt one another. Some estimates
											say that two million Americans are victims of violent crimes
											every year, a tragic, staggering number, perhaps an all-time
											record rate of violent crime. But there are almost 300 million
											Americans, which means that the odds of being a victim of
											violent crime is considerably less than one in a hundred on any
											given year. Furthermore, since many violent crimes are committed
											by repeat offenders, the actual number of violent citizens is
											considerably less than two million.<br>
											<br>
											Thus there is a paradox, and we must grasp both ends of the
											situation: We may well be in the most violent times in history,
											but violence is still remarkably rare. This is because most
											citizens are kind, decent people who are not capable of hurting
											each other, except by accident or under extreme provocation.
											They are sheep.<br>
											<br>
											I mean nothing negative by calling them sheep. To me it is like
											the pretty, blue robin's egg. Inside it is soft and gooey but
											someday it will grow into something wonderful. But the egg
											cannot survive without its hard blue shell. Police officers,
											soldiers, and other warriors are like that shell, and someday
											the civilization they protect will grow into something
											wonderful.? For now, though, they need warriors to protect them
											from the predators.<br>
											<br>
											"Then there are the wolves," the old war veteran said, "and the
											wolves feed on the sheep without mercy." Do you believe there
											are wolves out there who will feed on the flock without mercy?
											You better believe it. There are evil men in this world and they
											are capable of evil deeds. The moment you forget that or pretend
											it is not so, you become a sheep. There is no safety in
											denial.<br>
											<br>
											"Then there are sheepdogs," he went on, "and I'm a sheepdog. I
											live to protect the flock and confront the wolf." If you have no
											capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen,
											a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for
											your fellow citizens, then you have defined an aggressive
											sociopath, a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence,
											and a deep love for your fellow citizens? What do you have then?
											A sheepdog, a warrior, someone who is walking the hero's path.
											Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness, into the
											universal human phobia, and walk out unscathed.<br>
											<br>
											Let me expand on this old soldier's excellent model of the
											sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. We know that the sheep live in
											denial, that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to
											believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the
											fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire
											extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms and fire exits
											throughout their kids' schools.<br>
											<br>
											But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed
											police officer in their kid's school. Our children are thousands
											of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school
											violence than fire, but the sheep's only response to the
											possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to
											kill or harm their child is just too hard, and so they chose the
											path of denial.<br>
											<br>
											The sheep generally do not like the sheepdog. He looks a lot
											like the wolf. He has fangs and the capacity for violence. The
											difference, though, is that the sheepdog must not, cannot and
											will not ever harm the sheep. Any sheep dog who intentionally
											harms the lowliest little lamb will be punished and removed. The
											world cannot work any other way, at least not in a
											representative democracy or a republic such as ours.<br>
											<br>
											Still, the sheepdog disturbs the sheep. He is a constant
											reminder that there are wolves in the land. They would prefer
											that he didn't tell them where to go, or give them traffic
											tickets, or stand at the ready in our airports in camouflage
											fatigues holding an M-16. The sheep would much rather have the
											sheepdog cash in his fangs, spray paint himself white, and go,
											"Baa."<br>
											<br>
											Until the wolf shows up. Then the entire flock tries desperately
											to hide behind one lonely sheepdog. The students, the victims,
											at Columbine High School were big, tough high school students,
											and under ordinary circumstances they would not have had the
											time of day for a police officer. They were not bad kids; they
											just had nothing to say to a cop. When the school was under
											attack, however, and SWAT teams were clearing the rooms and
											hallways, the officers had to physically peel those clinging,
											sobbing kids off of them. This is how the little lambs feel
											about their sheepdog when the wolf is at the door.<br>
											<br>
											Look at what happened after September 11, 2001 when the wolf
											pounded hard on the door. Remember how America, more than ever
											before, felt differently about their law enforcement officers
											and military personnel? Remember how many times you heard the
											word hero?<br>
											<br>
											Understand that there is nothing morally superior about being a
											sheepdog; it is just what you choose to be. Also understand that
											a sheepdog is a funny critter: He is always sniffing around out
											on the perimeter, checking the breeze, barking at things that go
											bump in the night, and yearning for a righteous battle. That is,
											the young sheepdogs yearn for a righteous battle. The old
											sheepdogs are a little older and wiser, but they move to the
											sound of the guns when needed right along with the young
											ones.<br>
											<br>
											Here is how the sheep and the sheepdog think differently. The
											sheep pretend the wolf will never come, but the sheepdog lives
											for that day. After the attacks on September 11, 2001, most of
											the sheep, that is, most citizens in America said, "Thank God I
											wasn't on one of those planes." The sheepdogs, the warriors,
											said, "Dear God, I wish I could have been on one of those
											planes. Maybe I could have made a difference." When you are
											truly transformed into a warrior and have truly invested
											yourself into warriorhood, you want to be there. You want to be
											able to make a difference.<br>
											<br>
											There is nothing morally superior about the sheepdog, the
											warrior, but he does have one real advantage. Only one. And that
											is that he is able to survive and thrive in an environment that
											destroys 98 percent of the population. There was research
											conducted a few years ago with individuals convicted of violent
											crimes. These cons were in prison for serious, predatory crimes
											of violence: assaults, murders and killing law enforcement
											officers. The vast majority said that they specifically targeted
											victims by body language: slumped walk, passive behavior and
											lack of awareness. They chose their victims like big cats do in
											Africa, when they select one out of the herd that is least able
											to protect itself.<br>
											<br>
											Some people may be destined to be sheep and others might be
											genetically primed to be wolves or sheepdogs. But I believe that
											most people can choose which one they want to be, and I'm proud
											to say that more and more Americans are choosing to become
											sheepdogs. Seven months after the attack on September 11, 2001,
											Todd Beamer was honored in his hometown of Cranbury, New Jersey.
											Todd, as you recall, was the man on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania
											who called on his cell phone to alert an operator from United
											Airlines about the hijacking. When he learned of the other three
											passenger planes that had been used as weapons, Todd dropped his
											phone and uttered the words, "Let's roll," which authorities
											believe was a signal to the other passengers to confront the
											terrorist hijackers. In one hour, a transformation occurred
											among the passengers - athletes, business people and parents. --
											from sheep to sheepdogs and together they fought the wolves,
											ultimately saving an unknown number of lives on the ground.<br>
											<br>
											There is no safety for honest men except by believing all
											possible evil of evil men. - Edmund Burke Here is the point I
											like to emphasize, especially to the thousands of police
											officers and soldiers I speak to each year. In nature the sheep,
											real sheep, are born as sheep. Sheepdogs are born that way, and
											so are wolves. They didn't have a choice. But you are not a
											critter. As a human being, you can be whatever you want to be.
											It is a conscious, moral decision. If you want to be a sheep,
											then you can be a sheep and that is okay, but you must
											understand the price you pay. When the wolf comes, you and your
											loved ones are going to die if there is not a sheepdog there to
											protect you. If you want to be a wolf, you can be one, but the
											sheepdogs are going to hunt you down and you will never have
											rest, safety, trust or love. But if you want to be a sheepdog
											and walk the warrior's path, then you must make a conscious and
											moral decision every day to dedicate, equip and prepare yourself
											to thrive in that toxic, corrosive moment when the wolf comes
											knocking at the door.<br>
											<br>
											For example, many officers carry their weapons in church? They
											are well concealed in ankle holsters, shoulder holsters or
											inside-the-belt holsters tucked into the small of their backs.?
											Anytime you go to some form of religious service, there is a
											very good chance that a police officer in your congregation is
											carrying. You will never know if there is such an individual in
											your place of worship, until the wolf appears to massacre you
											and your loved ones. I was training a group of police officers
											in Texas, and during the break, one officer asked his friend if
											he carried his weapon in church. The other cop replied, "I will
											never be caught without my gun in church." I asked why he felt
											so strongly about this, and he told me about a cop he knew who
											was at a church massacre in Ft. Worth, Texas in 1999. In that
											incident, a mentally deranged individual came into the church
											and opened fire, gunning down fourteen people. He said that
											officer believed he could have saved every life that day if he
											had been carrying his gun. His own son was shot, and all he
											could do was throw himself on the boy's body and wait to die.
											That cop looked me in the eye and said, "Do you have any idea
											how hard it would be to live with yourself after that?"<br>
											<br>
											Some individuals would be horrified if they knew this police
											officer was carrying a weapon in church. They might call him
											paranoid and would probably scorn him. Yet these same
											individuals would be enraged and would call for "heads to roll"
											if they found out that the airbags in their cars were defective,
											or that the fire extinguisher and fire sprinklers in their kids'
											school did not work. They can accept the fact that fires and
											traffic accidents can happen and that there must be safeguards
											against them.<br>
											<br>
											Their only response to the wolf, though, is denial, and all too
											often their response to the sheepdog is scorn and disdain. But
											the sheepdog quietly asks himself, "Do you have and idea how
											hard it would be to live with yourself if your loved ones
											attacked and killed, and you had to stand there helplessly
											because you were unprepared for that day?"<br>
											<br>
											It is denial that turns people into sheep. Sheep are
											psychologically destroyed by combat because their only defense
											is denial, which is counterproductive and destructive, resulting
											in fear, helplessness and horror when the wolf shows up .<br>
											<br>
											Denial kills you twice. It kills you once, at your moment of
											truth when you are not physically prepared: you didn't bring
											your gun, you didn't train. Your only defense was wishful
											thinking. Hope is not a strategy. Denial kills you a second time
											because even if you do physically survive, you are
											psychologically shattered by your fear helplessness and horror
											at your moment of truth.<br>
											<br>
											Gavin de Becker puts it like this in Fear Less, his superb
											post-9/11 book, which should be required reading for anyone
											trying to come to terms with our current world situation:
											"...denial can be seductive, but it has an insidious side
											effect. For all the peace of mind deniers think they get by
											saying it isn't so, the fall they take when faced with new
											violence is all the more unsettling."<br>
											<br>
											Denial is a save-now-pay-later scheme, a contract written
											entirely in small print, for in the long run, the denying person
											knows the truth on some level. And so the warrior must strive to
											confront denial in all aspects of his life, and prepare himself
											for the day when evil comes. If you are warrior who is legally
											authorized to carry a weapon and you step outside without that
											weapon, then you become a sheep, pretending that the bad man
											will not come today. No one can be "on" 24/7, for a lifetime.
											Everyone needs down time. But if you are authorized to carry a
											weapon, and you walk outside without it, just take a deep
											breath, and say this to yourself "Baa."<br>
											<br>
											This business of being a sheep or a sheep dog is not a yes-no
											dichotomy. It is not an all-or-nothing, either-or choice. It is
											a matter of degrees, a continuum. On one end is an abject,
											head-in-the-sand-sheep and on the other end is the ultimate
											warrior. Few people exist completely on one end or the other.
											Most of us live somewhere in between. Since 9-11 almost everyone
											in America took a step up that continuum, away from denial. The
											sheep took a few steps toward accepting and appreciating their
											warriors, and the warriors started taking their job more
											seriously. The degree to which you move up that continuum, away
											from sheephood and denial, is the degree to which you and your
											loved ones will survive, physically and psychologically at your
											moment of truth.

											power on those that cannot defend themselves or won't fight
											back. Albert Camus said: <strong>"There is nothing more
												despicable than respect based on fear."</strong> Yet talk to
											90 percent of the so called horse experts and their first piece
											of advice is "Show the horse who is boss", nothing further from

													nervous and insecure. No saddle pad means the saddle is
													probably hurting the back and putting pressure points on
													the horses back. The REAR CINCH is extremely dangerous.
													Since there is not cinch connector between the front and
													rear cinch, the cinch is allowed to slide back in the
													Flank area of the horse where it irritates the sensitive
													under belly, which is exactly where they put it on
													Bucking horses, to make them buck. Now, when this horse
													bucks or flips over, the horse will be killed or put

											<strong><u>Making a Difference</u></strong>
										</center><strong><u></u></strong>
										<p></p>
										<p>I am often told that what I am doing will never change
											<strong>The Horse World</strong> since it is too far gone and
											too much money involved. So I tell this story:
										</p>
										<div class="indented">
											<p>There was once an old man and a child walking on the beach
												together. While walking they approach an area where
												thousands of fish are washed up on the beach flipping and
												flopping on the sand.<br>
												<br>
												The little boy picks up one of the fish and throws it back
												in the water.<br>
												<br>
												The old man laughs and says: "You think you can make a
												difference in all these 1000's of dying fish by doing
												that?"<br>
												<br>
												The boy looks up at the man and says: "It made a difference
												for that one."

											<u><strong>The Story of an Ass and a Married

										<br>
										<center>
											<img border="0" height="350" src="images2/donkey&#32;story.jpg" width="400">
										</center><br>
										<br>
										Once there was a couple that had a donkey. This couple traveled a
										long road to and from the market through several villages.<br>
										<br>
										As they passed the first village, they were riding the donkey and
										the people said they were mean for making the donkey carry them, so
										they got off and walked with the donkey.<br>
										<br>
										At the next village, the people said they were stupid for walking
										and one should ride the donkey. So the man let his wife ride.<br>
										<br>
										At the next village, the people said the wife should be a better
										wife and since her husband worked all day in the fields that she
										should let him ride. So they switched.<br>
										<br>
										At the last village, right before they had to cross a long swinging
										bridge across a large ravine, the people said they should be ashamed
										that they made their mule carry them since it worked and plowed
										their fields for the food they ate and that should carry the donkey
										and not make him walk. So they picked up the donkey and carried
										him.<br>
										<br>
										While crossing the swinging bridge, the wind blew, making the bridge
										swing and the couple dropped their donkey to it's death.<br>
										<br>
										<strong>The moral to the story:</strong><br>
										<br>
										<center>
											You cannot please everyone all the time and if you try, you will
											lose your ass.
										</center><br>
										<br>
										You will get lots of free advice in the horse world from people who
										think they know best - don't do things to your horse that can get it
										hurt or risk danger - just because lots of people give free advice.
										Your horse, your responsibility - the horse does not care if the
										advice was bad and caused the injury or death. However, it is a nice
										easy excuse for lazy people to blame others for what they do their
										horse.

											<u><strong>My Advice To People that Say I am Mean</strong></u>
										</center><u><strong></strong></u><strong></strong><br>
										<br>
										OK let me get this straight - you buy a 1200 pound wild reactionary
										instinctive flight or fight animal that has the power and ability to
										kill you or hurt you - you don't do your homework or research before
										you buy and now that you own this horse, you finally figure out not
										knowing what you are doing could get you hurt or killed - so you
										seek me out, ask me for help and say I don't like the way you talk,
										and you do not make me feel loved, so I don't want your help.<br>
										<br>
										<strong>Brilliant</strong> - in other words I would rather risk my
										life then get information that could save me?<br>
										<br>
										When people tell me this I refer them to my <strong>Mean Directions
											Story:</strong><br>
										<br>
										When you are lost and driving in the wrong direction heading for
										danger, running out of gas and you stop and ask for directions, if
										the person that tells you which way to go, but says it mean - Do you
										continue to go in the wrong direction just for spite until you find
										someone who gives you directions nicely? If you do - you give a new
										meaning to what a fool is.

										<p align="justify">I am reminded of a story when I see people
											worshiping the so called great horse whisperers, trainers &
											Natural Horsemen. These people follow without question, admire
											and worship these so called great men and women. I also see
											these same famous people becoming arrogant and using the horse
											for their fame, for profit and forgetting that <strong>- A horse
												is still a horse without a horseman - But a Horseman is only
												a man without a horse.</strong><br>
											<br>
											As the&nbsp;legend has it, Marcus Aurelius being fully aware of
											how power can corrupt a man, he hired a servant to follow him as
											he walked the empire's streets. Every time a citizen bowed to
											him, took a knee for him or called out some compliment or word
											of praise, Marcus Aurelius instructed the&nbsp;servant to
											whisper in his ear, <strong>"You're just a man. You're just a
												man."</strong><br>
											<br>
											He knew that the best way to test a man's character was to give
											him power and fame.<br>

										Until you have been put in a tree by a bull, you really can't
										appreciate the full meaning of this sign. When I was kid, me and a
										buddy were killing time in Texas, looking for pop bottles, walking
										railroad tracks and playing with cows. We decided to to mess a cow
										in a pasture and see if we could tip it over. About 3/4 of the way
										in, we realized it was not a cow but was a bull. We the chasers
										became the runners. Lucky for us there was a large tree in the
										middle of this pasture. We managed to beat the bull up the tree and
										thought we won, we were all happy to be alive and high fiving. The
										bull then decided to lay down under the tree in the shade. Three
										hours later, after peeing from a tree, the bull was not moving.
										About a hour later, the bull started grazing and got a little
										distance from the tree and we decided to make our move. Two dumass
										kids running for our lives, jumping a barbed wire fence at mach 1,
										only stopping after we were on the other side of the fence, where we
										decided to talk smack to the bull. That was our last cow tipping
										adventure. Wish this sign was posted on that pasture.

										Once upon a time there was a Chinese Farmer who lost a horse and the

										<br>
										And that evening all neighbors came around and said that's too
										bad<br>
										<br>
										And the Farmer said, Maybe?<br>
										<br>
										And the next day the horse returned and brought with him seven other
										wild horses.<br>
										<br>
										And that evening all the neighbors came and said that is great isn't
										it.<br>
										<br>
										And the Framer said, Maybe?<br>
										<br>
										The next day his son was riding and trying to tame one of the horses
										and was thrown and broke his leg.<br>
										<br>
										And all the neighbors came and said that is really bad isn't it<br>
										<br>
										And the Framer said, Maybe?<br>
										<br>
										The next day the army officers came by looking for soldiers and they
										saw his son had a broken leg and so they rejected his son because of
										the broken leg.<br>
										<br>
										And all the neighbors came and said isn't the wonderful<br>
										<br>
										And the Framer said Maybe?<br>
										<br>
										The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
										complexity and it is really impossible to tell weather anything that
										happens is either good or bad.<br>
										<br>
										Because you never know what will be the consequences of the
										misfortunes and you never know what will be the consequences of good
										fortune.<br>
										<br>
										<i><strong>**When you see a horse know that he does not know right
												or wrong. Those words have no meaning to a horse. They know

											<strong><u>The Five Monkeys Experiment</u></strong>
										</center><strong><u></u></strong> <u></u><br>
										<br>
										An experimenter puts 5 monkeys in a large cage. High up at the top
										of the cage, well beyond the reach of the monkeys, is a bunch of
										bananas. Underneath the bananas is a ladder.<br>
										<br>
										The monkeys immediately spot the bananas and one begins to climb the
										ladder. As he does, however, the experimenter sprays him with a
										stream of cold water. Then, he proceeds to spray each of the other
										monkeys.<br>
										<br>
										The monkey on the ladder scrambles off. And all 5 sit for a time on
										the floor, wet, cold, and bewildered. Soon, though, the temptation
										of the bananas is too great, and another monkey begins to climb the
										ladder. Again, the experimenter sprays the ambitious monkey with
										cold water and all the other monkeys as well. When a third monkey
										tries to climb the ladder, the other monkeys, wanting to avoid the
										cold spray, pull him off the ladder and beat him. The monkeys
										learned to associate going up the ladder with getting sprayed.<br>
										<br>
										Now one monkey is removed and a new monkey is introduced to the
										cage. Spotting the bananas, he naively begins to climb the ladder.
										The other monkeys pull him off and beat him.<br>
										<br>
										Here's where it gets interesting. The experimenter removes a second
										one of the original monkeys from the cage and replaces him with a
										new monkey. Again, the new monkey begins to climb the ladder and,
										again, the other monkeys pull him off and beat him including the
										monkey who had never been sprayed. Each original monkey is removed
										until no monkey that has ever been sprayed is still in the cage.<br>
										<br>
										By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys were left
										and yet, despite none of them ever experiencing the cold, wet,
										spray, they had all learned never to try and go for the bananas and
										they would continue to beat any new monkey that tied.<br>
										<br>
										If you could ask the Monkeys why they don't go for the Banana and
										why they beat others for trying, they would probably say:<br>
										<br>
										That is just how it has always been done.<br>
										<br>
										So, when people ask me why people still use archaic pain bits, horse
										shoes and barbaric training practices on horses, my answer is no
										good reason except "That is just how it has always been done."

										Once there was an old man walking on the beach. Early one morning,
										he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and saw
										the beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see,
										thousands of fish dying on the sand, stretching in both directions.
										<br><br>

										Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching. As
										the boy walked, the man could see that he was occasionally bending
										down to pick up a starfish and would throw it back into the sea. Has
										the boy got closer, the man called asked, what are you
										doing?"<br><br>

										The young boy replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide
										has washed them up onto the beach and they can't return to the sea
										by themselves, When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw
										them back into the water."<br><br>

										The old man replied, "But there must be tens of thousands of
										starfish on this beach. I'm afraid you won't really be able to make
										much of a difference by throwing a few back in."<br><br>

										The boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it back into
										the ocean. Then he turned, smiled and said to the old man, "It made
										a difference to that one! "

										<strong>HOW IS YOUR MORALS?</strong>
									</center>
									<p align="justify"> This is a great little test and appears somewhat
										accurate. I have given this several people over the years and it is
										right more than it is wrong.<br>
										<br>
										How moral are you? What is your attitude to morals, sex and honesty?
										The fascinating personality test below was written by a Sydney
										marriage expert who is a qualified psychologist. It began as a
										dinner party conversation gimmick, but it has been prepared in this
										form for readers to test themselves. To do the "test" you must give
										your honest opinion about morals and honesty of the four characters
										in our story of Sherwood Forest. Forget any preconceived ideas you
										may about them - this is a different sort of story from all the
										others.<br>
										<br>
										<strong>"The Sheriff of Nottingham captured Little John and Robin
											Hood and imprisoned them in his maximum - security dungeon. Maid
											Marion begged the Sheriff for their release, pleading her love
											for Robin. The Sheriff agreed to release them only if Maid
											Marion spent the night with him. To this she agreed. The next
											morning the Sheriff released his prisoners. Robin at once
											demanded that Marion tell him how she persuaded the Sheriff to
											let them go free. Marion confessed the truth, and was bewildered
											when Robin abused her, calling her a slut, and saying that he
											never wanted to see her again. At this Little John defended her,
											inviting her to leave Sherwood with him and promising life-long
											devotion. She accepted and they rode away
											together."</strong><br>
										<br>
										Now in terms of realistic everyday standards of behavior, put Robin,
										Marion, Little John, and the Sheriff in the order in which you
										consider they showed the most morality and honesty. There is no
										"right" answer, and the following is the psychologist's estimate of
										you for each of the 24 arrangements.
									</p>
									<p></p>
									<hr>
									<p align="justify"><strong>Conclusions:</strong><br>
										<br>
										1. ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You find it hard to accept
										the permissive attitudes of others, or to convince them of the
										validity of your own standards. You are not disposed to trust people
										and do not have a very happy life. (Men) To you "love" involves sex
										and duty, rather than charity and forgiveness. (Women) You blame men
										for much of the unhappiness in your life.<br>
										<br>
										2. ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: Your philosophy of life is a
										hotchpotch of the conventions of society, your own convictions and
										romanticism. You are not unkind, only staid and unimaginative. (Men)
										You see a woman as weak but desirable. (Women) Your resent the
										arrogance of men.<br>
										<br>
										3. ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN: As a ruthless authoritarian
										you are as moral as it suits you and no more. You do not apply the
										same rules to men as you do to women. (Men) We think you are
										unhappy, although you probably will not admit it. (Women) How
										worthless you seem to think women are.<br>
										<br>
										4. ROBIN, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, MARION: You have a very chauvinistic
										and outdated outlook on life. Your values and principles are defined
										not by clarity of conscience but by popular beliefs. Men: You see
										women as objects and possessions. You demand complete loyalty and
										devotion without offering it in return. Women: You see yourself as
										having only one purpose in life - to satisfy your man. You lack self
										definition as you derive all of who you are from him.<br>
										<br>
										5. ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF: You are a moralist with
										conventional ideas, which some people would call old-fashioned.
										(Men) You probably consider yourself a fair-minded man in a world
										which falls badly below your standards. Your inhibitions and sense
										of guilt are in the way of your happiness. (Women) Unlucky in love?
										Perhaps you hope for too much in a man. Be a realist, not a
										romantic.<br>
										<br>
										6. ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION: You are conventional and
										puritanical. (Men) You moralize and see women as a great conspiracy
										against man, with sex as their principal weapon. You are missing a
										great deal in life. (Women) Your parents probably played a big part
										in the formation of such a guilt complex as yours. Your mind is in
										chains and it's time you did something to free it.<br>
										<br>
										7. LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF, MARION: You are not easy to assess.
										Basically you are ruled by an inferiority complex and feelings of
										insecurity. How do you present yourself to the world? An idealist, a
										moralist, a conformist keeping up with the Jones? (Men) Your
										conflicting views on sex and morality may lead to every sort of
										sexual problem. You have always feared women, probably starting with
										your mother. (Women) It is a shame you have not accepted the ideal
										of woman as the equal (and sometimes stronger) partner of man.<br>
										<br>
										8. LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF: You are fairly broadminded
										romantic and reasonably contented. You value kindness greatly and
										try to live by your ideals. You do not conceal from yourself, or
										from others, your strong need for security, which may be either
										emotional or material. (Men) Perhaps you tend to idealize women and
										credit them with virtues they don't possess. (Women) Your
										experiences of men have not all been happy, perhaps because you hope
										for a little too much?<br>
										<br>
										9. LITTLE JOHN, MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You are the slightly
										romantic realist. You respect truth, and are broadminded and
										flexible. Whether you are a man or a woman you are probably a happy
										person. You like people and they can readily make friends with you.
										You are not very adventurous, but this does not bother you.<br>
										<br>
										10. LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION, SHERIFF: You are a cautious type,
										neutral, and rather insecure. You would agree with the idea that
										everybody has his price - and in your own case it would not be high.
										(Men) You are sexually inhibited with an underlying distrust of
										women. (Women) At least one man has made you unhappy, and you are
										now on your guard.<br>
										<br>
										11. LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN: You too, believe that
										morality is another word for common-sense and suitability, and not
										something which is universally valid or a religious truth. Your
										feeling for security is strong, and you would rate reliability as
										one of your virtues. (Men) Your estimate of women as the inferior
										sex suggests that you are a little uncertain of them. (Women) You
										are more permissive about the morals of others than you are about
										your own.<br>
										<br>
										12. LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION: You are conventional,
										unimaginative, and something of a prude. It would be surprising if
										your love life was a roaring success. (Man) You have an old-world
										authoritarian attitude. One thing is sure - you have some sorry
										illusions about women. (Women) You accept a double standard of
										morality in which women are very much the "second sex".<br>
										<br>
										13. MARION, SHERIFF, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN: Associate morality with
										honest and truth more than with religious values. You are impulsive
										and somewhat unpredictable. (Men) We suspect that you are a would-be
										lover rather than a very successful one. (Women) You are a realist
										and a rebel, a defender of women's rights. You like men but despise
										weak ones.<br>
										<br>
										14. MARION, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: Such an emphatic rejection
										of ready-made values in probably partly camouflage. You hate to be
										thought weak or insecure. You value honesty, and abominate humbug
										and hypocrisy. (Men) Women are very much part of you life, and you
										are - or perhaps would like to be - quite ruthless, both with women
										and life in general. (Women) You are tolerant about men and their
										failings - but we mean men, for you have no time for boys on men's
										errands.<br>
										<br>
										15. MARION, ROBIN, SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN: You know the so-called
										facts of life, but not to enjoy life itself. You are not a realist
										and you are inclined to be stubborn. (Men) Women, you think, are
										either whores or angels, and you over-estimate the differences
										between the sexes. A woman may find you difficult to live with.
										(Women) You are not sure whether truth and morality go hand in hand
										or are in opposition. You haven't a very high opinion of men.<br>
										<br>
										16, MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF: If you are not happy - and
										we suspect you are not - it maybe because you feel guilty about your
										own emotions, and lack confidence in your opinions. (Men) No doubt
										you consider yourself a moral man, and a fair one. Your fuzzy ideas
										about morality may make their mark on your sex life. (Women) You are
										too concerned about what others think.<br>
										<br>
										17. MARION, LITTLE JOHN, SHERIFF, ROBIN: You are essentially a
										contented person, even if you consider yourself a little superior.
										You are moral by your own standards, for you believe that morality
										is what best suits the occasion. (Men) You are sexually uninhibited,
										more romantic than you may appear, and more dependent on the
										approval of others than you care to admit. (Women) You like being a
										woman, you understand what love is, and frankly enjoy sex.<br>
										<br>
										18. MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, SHERIFF: We would expect you to be a
										happy, well-balanced person who likes people and is liked by others.
										You question whether many conventional views on morality are valid
										under all circumstances. (Men) Do we detect a sense of chivalry and
										idealism under the sophistication? (Women) You will expect high
										standards from the men to whom you give your love.<br>
										<br>
										19, SHERIFF, ROBIN, MARION, LITTLE JOHN: (Man) We find it hard to
										imagine you leading a full, happy life. The warmth and give-and-take
										of love are not for you. Your sex life is ringed with unreality, and
										you neither understand nor appreciate women. (Women) If you really
										believe this is the right order, you baffle us completely.<br>
										<br>
										20, SHERIFF, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN, MARION: Although you make a brave
										show of being self-sufficient, beneath this you are unhappy and
										rather mixed up. (Men) You don't understand women - probably you are
										afraid of them. You do not know what love is, and you are more
										likely to boast about your conquests in a bar than prove them in a
										bedroom. (Women) If men attract you at all, they probably be
										disastrously the wrong sort.<br>
										<br>
										21. SHERIFF, MARION, ROBIN, LITTLE JOHN: If you are not living a
										happy life the cause is within yourself. You are a rebel...with a
										trace of spoilt child about you. You value truth above morality, but
										you are reasonably tolerant of those who disagree with you. (Men)
										any problems you have are not likely to be centered in sex. (Women)
										Despite your experience and intelligence you are a bad judge of
										men.<br>
										<br>
										22. SHERIFF, MARION, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN: You claim to be a realist
										or even a cynic, but you are more emotional and romantic and
										truthful. (Men) although you are by no means inhibited, your amorous
										adventures are as much a matter of fantasy as fact. (Women) You have
										been hurt in the past by men -or perhaps a particular man and will
										probably let it happen again.<br>
										<br>
										23. SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, ROBIN, MARION: Not a moralizing pattern,
										but...(Men) You share with many other men the idea that most women
										are fickle and inferior to men. Perhaps a view that you got from
										your father? Or as a reaction to a domineering mother? (Women) You
										have a pretty poor opinion of yourself, haven't you?<br>
										<br>
										24. SHERIFF, LITTLE JOHN, MARION, ROBIN: You have a confused,
										immature sense of values. You are erratic and stubborn, and inclined
										to get angry or sulk when you don't get your own way. But at least
										you are not a moral hypocrite. (Men) "Love 'em and leave 'em" is the
										motto of a man who is basically afraid of women. (Women) Perhaps you
										would rather be a man than a woman?<br>
										<br>

												If a Hammer Is Your Only Tool - Then You Will Treat Every
												Problem has a Nail </strong> </u>
								</center>
								<br><br>
								<p align="justify">
									This is said a lot and I use it a lot, but not sure everyone understands
									it. The short answer is if you only have one way to deal with every
									problem, you will fail more than you succeed. <br><br>

									Knowledge give you options and understanding. Not all problems are the
									same and cannot be fixed the same way. If you don't expand your
									understanding and knowledge of a problem you cannot fix it. <br><br>

									If you don't understand that you created the problem, you will not
									understand to fix or prevent the problem. <br><br>

									If you don't have the ability to see the problem from the horse's point
									of view, then you will not be able to help the horse to see it from its
									point view. <br><br>

									Especially when dealing with kids, animals or horses, you must have the
									ability to understand that they have different experiences in life, have
									different levels of education and learning styles, and NOT one method
									works for everyone or everything. So having many tools, knowledge and
									understanding is essential for you to be able to see the problem
									differently and address it with a various and multitude of solutions.
									NOT just beat it with the same hammer. <br><br>

									So when someone says, if a hammer is your ONLY tool, you will treat
									every problem as a Nail. They are saying to you not seeing the big
									picture. You are being small minded and can't see outside your box of
									information. You are not dealing the problem from the horse's point of
									view but only from YOUR point of view. If you only have a hammer, which
									is used for hitting, then you limit yourself to hitting every problem
									with the your only hammer. <br><br>

									However, if you expand yourself and your knowledge, if you develop
									different tools and different ways of dealing with problems, then you
									become more proficient and are able to deal with different problems in
									better more effective and efficient ways, than to just beat it with a
									hammer. <br><br>

									In horses, small minded, know-it-alls have all the answers. They cannot
									see past their own self inflated ego so they have every horse problems
									by blaming the horse, calling the horse names, showing the horse who is
									boss, through pain fear and intimidation, since that is all their small
									minds can know. <br><br>

									An accomplished horseman, can see the bigger picture. He will see
									problems as HIS failures, his lack of abilities and will find and look
									for ways to make it easier on the horse. He will help the horse grow and
									work through the problem, and not force or blame the horse. He will find
									a DIFFERENT way since he knows that all horses are not the same. He will
									work the problem slower and take more time rather than forcing the issue
									with pain and rushing the horse. He will know he has a hammer but will
									not use it, because he knows there is a better way. He will always be
									trying to grow and enhance his tool box so he will never need to use his
									hammer, because that is better for the horse. There are no horse
									problems, there is only people problems blamed on the horse. <br><br>

									So in short, if you only know, beat the horse, show him who is boss,
									only use bigger bits, whips, spurs and run horses in circles, then you
									only have a hammer, and is what you will use for every problem. <br><br>

										hammer in their tool box.</strong>

												The Story of Mr. T, Buddy & Smokey
									</strong></u>
							</center> <br><br>
							<b>
								Buddy is a Quarter horse </b><br>
							Buddy's color is known as a Palomino or Golden Palomino <br>
							Buddy is 63 inches tall<br>
							Dad Sire: Tucker Cash<br>
							Mom Dam: Joanne Jackolina <br>
							Born: May of 2004<br><br>

							Buddy had a bad front tooth from a kick and could not be shown in competitions
							and the owner liked mares over geldings, so she gave him to me because Buddy
							liked me.<br><br>
							<b>
								Mr. T (Montana, Tanner or Big T) </b> <br>
							Mr. T was caught in the Wild from wild herds of Mustangs in Nevada, so he is a
							Mustang<br>
							Color of Mr. T is known as a Seal Brown, when seal are dry look brown when wet
							they look black<br>
							Mr. T is about 63 inches tall<br>
							Born Feb in 1992<br> <br>

							He was caught in Granite Range Nevada, captured by Helicopter and reason for
							captured was listed as Emergency. Mr. T was sold three different times for being
							crazy and un-rideable and to wild to train. In BLM government rules, if a
							Mustang is turned back in to BLM as untamable or untrainable the BLM will kill
							them for being dangerous. Of course with no consideration that the idiot owners
							are the real problem.<br><br>
							<b>
								Smokey Mokie Cat</b><br>
							Smokey Cat was wild kitty that was roaming the woods around the house when I
							moved here in 2013. He looked like he was less than a year old. I started
							feeding him and he stayed around, so I got him fixed and now he lives here.
