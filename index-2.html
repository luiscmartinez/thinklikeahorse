											in the frog and that is not good for the hoof. If you smell a foul odor when
											picking the feet, it could indicate the start of thrush. Spraying a little
											bleach and water (50/50 mix) in the frog once a week or so will help kill
											bacteria and help prevent thrush. Don't forget to pick your horse's feet
											before you ride, before you trailer, anytime they are brought in from

										</p>


										<p align="justify">I get a few questions about why horses spread their legs out
											when peeing. It seems common sense to me, but I thought I would give my
											take.</p>


										<p align="justify">No horse likes to pee on himself, the splash gets on their
											legs and feels like a fly or insect or bug crawling on their fur, and the
											scent marks them so predators can smell them easier. Horses are pretty clean
											and never lay in the pee or poop in the wild. However, humans want to lock
											up horses in a stall and force the horse to ignore this clean instinct so
											stalled horses will lay down and stand in their feces and urine. No horse
											wants to smell like horse poop or horse urine when they are being hunted by
											predators, so their instinct is to not pee or poop on themselves.</p>


										<p align="justify">If a rider was more aware they know that horses always
											(normally) stand cross wind when peeing, so the wind will blow the pee to
											the side and not on the back or front legs, so when horses pee in pasture
											they will put their side to the wind. Most riders never let the horse do
											this when they ride, so the horse has to "park out" (stand really wide and
											spread out) in an attempt to avoid wind spray or splash.</p>


										<p align="justify">So peeing on dirt, rubber mats, concrete will all cause a
											horse to park out wider and in a bigger stance.</p>


										<p align="justify">A good horseman will read this and when stopping a horse will
											face them cross wind so the horse can pee without getting wet over spray.

											<u></u><br>


											<br>


											Common cocklebur is a highly branched, taproot, broadleaved annual that
											grows from 8 inches to 6 feet (0.2 to 2m) high. The dull green leaves
											alternate along the stem, are coarsely toothed, and often have three to five
											shallow lobes. The leaf stalks are about as long as the leaves.<br>


											<br>


											The flower heads of common cocklebur are unisexual. Small male and female
											flowers form separate clusters. Male (staminate) flowers are in short
											terminal spikes or clusters, and the burlike female (pistillate) flowers are
											in axillary clusters. The distinct seed pods, or burs of cocklebur make the
											weed easy to identify. Burs are light brown, Y2 to 1 inch (1 to 2.5 cm)
											long, and oval or oblong. They are covered with stout, hooked prickles,
											which terminate in two hooked spines. Each prickle is 1/10 to 1/4 inch (2 to
											6 mm) long.<br>


											<br>


											Each bur contains two brown to black achenes (seeds), one above the other.
											The lower seed can germinate immediately; the upper seed is dormant and does
											not germinate until months or often years later. Seeds are about 1/2 inch
											(12 to 14 mm) long and 1/5 (4.5 to 5 mm) wide. Mature burs are dispersed
											primarily by humans and animals.<br>


											<br>


											Seeds germinate from early spring through summer, from depths of up to 6
											inches (15 cm). Seeds and small seedlings are toxic to humans and livestock,
											but toxicity decreases rapidly as the first true leaves develop. Regardless
											of size, common cocklebur flowers from August through October in response to
											day length.<br>

											Complete control of common cocklebur is often difficult because some of the
											seeds remain dormant in the soil for months or even years. Early-season
											control is important because cocklebur grows rapidly and, once established,
											can be a long-term problem.<br>


											<br>


											The most effective control measure is to prevent seed production.
											Cultivation practices and herbicide applications can also be effective. No
											single herbicide gives good full-season control; therefore, both
											preemergence and postemergence herbicide applications are necessary.<br>


											<br>


											For most effective postemergence control, cocklebur must be shorter than 8
											inches (20 cm) at time of treatment, and herbicides must be applied under
											good growing conditions.<br>

											<strong>FUN FACT ABOUT COCKELBUR AND VELCRO</strong><br>


											<br>


											<u>VELCRO WAS MODELED AFTER BURRS OF THE BURDOCK PLANT</u><br>


											<br>


											The inventor of Velcro, more generically known as a "hook and loop fastener"
											or "touch fastener" as "Velcro" is technically just a brand of that product,
											was Swiss engineer, Georges de Mestral. After going out on a hunting trip
											with his dog in the Swiss Alps, his pant legs and his dog's hair were
											covered in burrs from the burdock plant. As an engineer, he naturally began
											to wonder how exactly the seeds stuck so effectively to his pants and his
											dog. He then examined the burrs under a microscope and discovered that they
											had very tiny hooks which allowed the seeds to catch on to things like
											fabrics, which have tiny loops.<br>

											<img align="left" border="3" height="166" src="images/HorseFencing.bmp"
												width="155"> scary for horses and they get trapped when scared, chased

											fence. Get rid of corners and you help your horse stay safe. If your fences
											have corners, you can place 2X6s or 2X4s at an angle to remove the corners.
											If you have extra temporary panels, you can use them to put in the fence
											corners at an angle to remove the corner. Horses don't get trapped in round
											areas or angles. In the<img align="right" border="3"
												src="images/roundrailfence.jpg"> picture (above left) I have shown how
											to place boards or panels in corners to remove the corner. The "Y" with dots

											install a roof from post to post for shade protection as well. On the topic
											of fences and <img align="left" border="3" height="170"
												src="images/burnfence.jpg" width="170">gates. All gates should only open
											inwards towards the horses. This way if a gate is ever left unlocked the
											horses cannot open them by pushing on the gate. This also makes it easier to
											get horses since you don't have to latch the gate while putting on halters
											or catching your horse, you can simply close it and the horse can't push it
											open. The expensive nice white plastic fencing is very popular but not real
											functional. The picture to the left is a plastic fence after a fire. Not a
											pretty sight. There are good fences made of pipe that goes up easy, is
											strong and easy to repair, but you have research and do your homework.

											about this topic. The noise you hear when a male horse runs or trots does
											NOT mean his sheath needs cleaning. That is the most absurd thing I have
											heard and I hear it a lot. People that know little about a horse want to
											give advice and just keep passing on this bunk to promote this rumor. Here
											are some other things I hear about this noise; the noise is made since the
											testicles have been removed, because the sheath is dirty, because air is
											trapped, it is when the horse is tense and only geldings make the noise. You
											will hear this noise normally when a horse is trotting but can also hear it
											during a canter. When a horse is tense, stressed, being resistant, showing
											frustration, excited or is trying to show dominance, he will make this
											noise. Not sure if the horse does it intentionally or by reflex (I think it
											is intentional). It is a squeaking, grunting or honking noise and sounds
											like trapped air being forced out or kept in the sheath area. Some say it
											happens when the horse pulls his penis up higher into his sheath, which
											creates an air pocket. It normally happens when a horse is tense
											(resistant). When a horse is relaxed you will normally not hear the noise. I
											think you will also hear it when a horse is showing resistance or dominance.
											A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion"
												target="_blank"><u>stallion</u></a> or <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelding" target="_blank"><u>proud cut
													gelding</u></a> will make the noise when entering a herd or trying
											to attract attention to him so he can impress the herd and announce his
											presence. Is he doing it intentionally or by the fact that he is tense and
											showing off, not sure, but I think they know when they do it. A mare will
											not make this noise, so I have to think it has to do with the male parts.
											When a horse is trying to impress mares or about to defend his position to
											another horse, I would say he is tense and showing dominance, which would
											coincide with the idea that the horse is tense and excited, which could mean
											he is retracting his penis and creating an air trap. The next time you hear
											this noise, see if the horse is being resistant, testing the owner, showing
											dominance, or is not wanting to do what he is doing. You will find it has
											nothing to do with a clean or dirty sheath. So please stop the rumor that
											the sheath is dirty and that is why the noise is there, it just ain't so.

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>The Rear Cinch:</u></strong> To have or not to
											have? How tight should it be? This is some of the<img align="right"
												border="3" height="200" src="images/sinch.jpg" width="200"> most
											discussed and hot topic of horsemen. Some say you don't need it, others say
											it is a must. Some say it should be loose, others say it should be tight.
											Not sure if there is a right or wrong, just pros and cons. I rode for years
											without one and years with one. I think you should have one. It keeps the
											saddle more secure, allows you to pull or dally up (drag something with a
											rope like another horse or log) and helps prevent the saddle from sliding or
											moving as much. When in a canter, it keeps the saddle from popping up and
											down so much and banging on the horses back. As for how tight, I like it
											snug. If you see a loop or space before you get in the saddle, this space
											and loop will get bigger once you get in the saddle, as your weight pushes
											down on the saddle. Any space is a place where twigs, branches or stickers
											can get caught and send the horse into a spook. When going up or down a
											hill, a horse can get his hoof caught in this slack or loop and you will
											have real troubles. If too loose it pops under the horse's belly as he runs
											and may cause a spook. I don't make it as tight as the front cinch, but snug
											enough to see no gap after I am in the saddle. Since it gets loose once you
											get on the saddle, it should be fairly snug before you mount. (In my
											opinion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_%28tack%29"
												target="_blank"><u>the rear cinch</u></a> in the photo is too loose
											since you can see a gap) Here is a link to a video of proper cinching:<a

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>How Tight Should the Front Cinch Be?</strong></u>
											<strong></strong>
										</p>


										<p align="justify">As for the front cinch, I get asked this all the time
											<i><strong>How tight should the cinch be?.</strong></i><strong></strong>
											There is not a right answer for how tight a cinch should be, <u>it
												depends</u> on many factors. It depends on the saddle (how well it
											fits), on the pad (how thick or thin), on who is riding (rider experience,
											weight, balance, skills), on the size and build of the horse, what type of
											saddle (English or Western), on the experience of the horse (older calmer
											not as tight as a new green horse), what type of riding (hills and ditches
											or smooth level arena), type of cinch (cotton, wool, felt, neoprene), type
											of latigo (leather or nylon), temperature and weather conditions outside,
											experience of rider and many other factors.
										</p>


										<p align="justify">The tighter the cinch, the more the issues. Too tight is very
											uncomfortable for the horse, it can cause sore spots, rub burns, pinch the
											skin and make the horse irritable and bucky. Too loose and it can allow the
											saddle to slide off center or back. The tightness of the cinch is a fluid
											issue/decision. It changes as other things change. Temp can cause horses to
											sweat more in the cinch area and under the saddle pad. <strong>My rule
												is:</strong> As tight as it can without cutting the horse in half - but
											as loose as possible to keep me in the saddle. Since I am very aware of my
											balance, I adjust my saddle pretty regularly so my cinch is not very tight
											(many tell me I need to tighten my cinch), unless I am working cattle, doing
											hills, working on stops and turns, then I make it tighter. I try and
											<strong>think like a horse</strong> so I try and keep it as comfortable as
											possible. However, that means more work and more awareness on my part. It
											also means there is a greater chance of my saddle sliding if my horse spooks
											or I get lazy in the saddle. So having it a little loose keeps me on my
											toes, it forces me to get better, it makes me have better balance and not
											depend on the tight cinch to keep my saddle straight. It means I may have to
											dismount and tighten my cinch in some areas and then dismount and make it
											loose in other areas. Some people think this is too much work so they just
											put it as tight as they can and make the horse deal with it. That is poor
											horsemanship. That is taking the easy and fast way. That is being lazy so
											you have to think or get on and off your horse. Nevertheless, it is more
											common and that is what is taught by poor horsemen that don't know any
											better.

										<p align="justify">So when people ask me this question, like most horse
											questions, there is no easy fast right answer, <strong>It Depends.</strong>

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Weight on Kidneys:</strong></u> When riding a
											horse and they have to urinate, lean forward and shift your weight to the
											front of the horse. This will take weight off the rear part of the saddle
											and the back of the horse.<img align="right" border="3" height="250"
												src="images/horse-digest.jpg" width="250"> Taking weight off the rear
											and back of the horse will release pressure off the back and kidney area.
											This will make it a little more comfortable for your horse while they take
											care of business. Horsemen are always aware of the little things that make
											it easier and better on the horse. Remember to stay balanced and centered on
											the horse, when a horse parks out and spreads his legs to pee, they are off
											balance, the last thing he needs is a rider moving around leaning, moving
											and throwing off his balance. Same thought process on letting your horse
											stop to poop. I see and hear people all the time yacking at their horse
											about how they can poop and walk or telling someone else not to let their
											horse stop and poop. Sure your horse can poop and walk or run, but why make
											it? I hear that if you are at a "show" the judges will mark you down for
											letting your horse stop and poop. Stupid judges! They should give you extra
											credit for being a good horseman and caring about your horse. Your horse
											would probably pee while running if you never let stop, but what would be
											the point. A horse does not like to pee on itself and does not like to poop
											on itself. So letting your horse stop, relax and take care of business is
											not a bad thing, it is not a lack of control, it is not your horse being
											resistant and stubborn, it is simply a horse wanting to stop and set up so
											it does not poop or pee on itself. See it for what it is and not for what
											some judge sees it. Good horsemen treat their horse like they would want to
											be treated. If I see someone letting their horse stop and poop and see
											someone yelling at their horse for trying to stop and poop, guess which one
											I think is the better horseman?</p>

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Loosen the Cinch:</strong></u> A good friend will
											help his friend feel comfortable. When dismounting, loosen the cinch and
											give your horse a break. When a saddle is cinched down it constricts blood
											flow, it is tight on the horse, sweat makes the skin itch and it gets more
											uncomfortable the longer it is worn. If you ever wore a tight pair of shoes,
											remember how good it felt to slip them off if only for a few seconds. A good
											horseman will always loosen the cinch when he dismounts to give his horse a
											break/breather. This will allow air and blood flow under the cinch and under
											the saddle to help cool the horse and make him feel more comfortable. Your
											friend will appreciate even a short break. Watch people dismount, if they
											immediately loosen the cinch, you can tell they understand a horse, are
											concerned about their horse and they are a good horseman. <br><br>

											<br><br>






											I get asked what cinch is best. I like <b>Mohair cinches</b>. They are
											softer than rope and tend to naturally lock into the horse's hair without
											pulling it out. In the picture above you will notice one cinch is wider than
											the other. <b> I like the wider ones.</b> It goes back to surface area. The
											wider cinch will have more contact with the horse than the narrow one. More
											contact means less pressure on the horse. Since you have more surface area
											you do not need to get the cinch as tight since you have more contact to
											keep the saddle in place. <br><br>






											Imagine having just one or two mohair ropes as a cinch, you would have to
											cut the horse in half to get the saddle to stay put. So it goes to reason
											that if you have wider and increase the number of ropes contacting the horse
											then you will have better contact, less slippage and will NOT have put the
											cinch as tight.

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Mounting</strong></u> a horse from only one side
											sets your horse up for failure. If you ever have to mount or dismount from
											the other side, your horse will be confused and nervous. A horse needs to
											know that you can get on or off from either side. If you ever need to
											dismount on a steep hill or ledge and you have never taught your horse this,
											you will be in a bad fix. This is easy to teach. Start by getting off your
											horse on the right side. After a few times with no issues, only get off on
											the right side half way, then get back in the saddle. Soon you will be able
											to mount or dismount from either side. You should always try to mount your
											horse from different objects like a tailgate, a fence, the bumper of your
											trailer or the top side of a ditch. This will teach the horse that it is ok
											for you to mount from anywhere. Read my <a href="index-1.html"
												target="_blank"><u>Horse History</u></a> page to find out why mounting
											only on the left got started. Remember, when mounting on a hill, always
											mount from the high side of the horse. This makes you higher and prevents
											you from pulling the horse down on top of you or pulling the horse down the
											hill. And don't forget to sit softly in the saddle. I see too many people
											just slam their butts in the saddle and I watch the poor horse's back sink,
											their ears flinch and I see the pain and uncomfortableness on their face.
											Ease into the saddle softly (as if you were sitting on a friend's lap) so it
											will not put undue stress on the horse's back. Remember anytime you mount or
											dismount, be ready for a blow up and only have your toe in the stirrup, once
											you are in the saddle you can move your foot to the proper position. See a

											<strong><u>Let's Talk Saddle Fit</u></strong>


										</center>


										<p></p>


										<p align="justify">Is there a perfect saddle fit? What is it? How do you know? I
											happen to think a good wool pad is more important than a perfect saddle fit.
											For years, all saddles were made about the same and people rode one saddle
											on many different horses. Is it a perfect system? It may not be, but is it
											bad or damaging to the horse, probably not. I see many people very worried
											and willing to go to great lengths to ensure good saddle fit yet they are
											overweight, ride like crap, have no balance, no rhythm, no seat, no leg
											strength, but by gosh that saddle fits good.</p>


										<p align="justify">I have one saddle and it has been on no less than 50 horses
											and it fits fine on most horses in my book. Some horses are smaller and some
											are bigger. Now with that said if I was riding a large Clydesdale draft
											horse, then my saddle may not fit.</p>


										<p align="justify">Another dumb thing I see people doing is putting a saddle on
											a horse with NO pad to see if it fits. Really, is that the way you see if a
											saddle fits? If you have a good 3/4 or 1-inch wool pad with a curved back
											between the saddle and horse, the shape or fit of a saddle is nowhere near
											what a saddle fits like when sitting directly on the horses back with no
											pad.</p>


										<p align="justify"><strong>NEWS FLASH:</strong> Saddles are not designed to be
											on a horse <strong>WITHOUT</strong> a pad. Now of course you have all these
											new gimmicks (fancy new pads) in gel, foam, neoprene, magic cushion, space
											age pads or whatever. Everyone trying to make a buck on the constant NEW
											dumb horse people and sell them something new and improved.</p>


										<p align="justify">Some will say you need to measure your horse to get a proper
											fit, but what if the horse is slim or has some winter fat, or gains weight,
											what about extra hair in winter, what if the horse back starts to sag, or
											the horse develops muscle, what about if you change your pad or get a
											different pad, as you can see there are lots of variables that are not
											always constant. Proper saddle fit isn't an exact science.</p>


										<p align="justify">To me a proper saddle fit is a good quality and well-built
											saddle designed for the type of horses you ride. A good saddle should clear
											a horse's withers (no contact when you are in the saddle) and allow the
											shoulders to move freely and unrestricted.</p>

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Horse Trailer:</strong></u> When buying a trailer,
											think of the horse. If you ever watch a horse standing inside a stock
											trailer, they will be standing at a slant and not straight with<img
												align="right" border="3" height="250" src="images/horsepanic.jpg"
												width="250"> their head in the front and butt in the rear. Standing at a
											slant is more comfortable for the horse. It enables them to balance better
											and control weight shift during turns, acceleration and stops. If involved
											in an accident or sudden stop, a slant stance will transfer weight along the
											side of the body/trailer divider and not just the head and neck, like if the
											horse is standing in a straight load. So if the horse chooses to stand at a
											slant when given a choice, why would a person buying a trailer buy a
											straight load? I think the horse prefers a slant load trailer, therefore, I
											prefer them. The picture above is what happens when a horse is forced in a
											trailer and locked in and then panics.</p>

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>Gates:</u></strong> I see lots of people being
											careful while going through gates. They take their time to be extra careful
											not to bump their horse with the gate. That teaches a horse that the gate is
											never going to touch him. Let the gate bump him, close it on his butt, use
											the gate to ease him through the gate and let it hit, bump or rub his legs,
											hips, shoulders and other body parts. Let him know that when a gate hits or
											bumps him, it is no big deal and he can ignore it and will not be hurt. Once
											a horse gets comfortable with the gate he will start pushing it open or
											close it for you. By trying to protect the horse too much, we teach the
											horse that things will never scare him. A horse needs to get scared so he
											knows that he does not have to be scared.</p>


										<p align="justify">Another thing about gates is they tend to be gathering places
											for people and horses. This is bad and dangerous for both. People tend to
											want to pet and say goodbye or hello to their horse all at the gate. This
											teaches bad lessons and causes problems down the road. First of all gates
											are normal gathering places since horses learn that they get out there and
											get fed there, they get treats there, they get attention there, so the draw
											to the gate is already too strong. Now you people that want to put gates in
											corners and increase the danger ten fold. Then you get people who want to
											put water buckets near or next to the gate, now you increase the danger 20
											fold.</p>


										<p></p>
										<hr>
										<p></p>


										<p align="justify">Gates should be for walking in and walking out, period. Don't
											feed at gates, don't put water or food at gates, don't stand, pet and
											encourage horses to gather at gates. This only encourages horses to gather
											and increases the chance of a horse getting kicked or people getting run
											over and or both.</p>

											crisis. My horses allow me to cover their eyes with a rag, t-shirt,
											sweatshirt, or scarf. Then I lead them around while blindfolded.<img
												align="left" border="3" height="176" src="images/blindfold.jpg"
												width="140">This is an advanced sack out technique. It builds trust and
											lets the horse know that when he can't see, he can trust me to move him and
											walk him safely. If you ever are caught in a forest fire, barn fire or <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture"
												target="_blank"><u>pasture</u></a> fire, this will be very valuable for
											you and your horse. Having the ability to take away your horse's sight and
											still having him responsive to you, temporarily, is good for you and the
											horse. It may help you save your horse. Also remember that if <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable" target="_blank"><u>your
													barn</u></a> is ever on fire, don't let your horse go right outside
											the barn. The horse will be nervous and scared and may panic and run back to
											his stall for comfort and safety, not thinking about the fire.</p>

											The more you trust your horse - - the more your horse will trust you.<img
												align="right" border="3" height="250" src="images/underhorse.jpg"
												width="250"> If you understand and trust your horse, you should be able
											to lay on your horse's back, slide off his butt, stand behind him
											comfortably, crawl under him, sit under him while grooming his belly and
											back legs and lay down beside him and rub him with your feet as you lay on
											your back. All of this builds trust. It teaches the horse to relax with you
											knowing you will not hurt him. It teaches you to read your horse, to trust
											him and to know how far you can go, when to release and when to go slower. I
											look at this as a calming exercise. Crawling around under my horse tells my
											horse to trust me no matter what I am doing and it teaches me to trust him.
											It is a little scary, I get a little nervous sometimes, but I always trust
											my horse more afterward I am done. Just like the horse, sometimes we have to
											get scared to know that we do not have to be scared. Going slow at first,
											coming from under a horse from one side puts you in a blind spot under the
											horse so if you come out too fast, it may startle the horse. This is also
											good to teach the horse that it is OK for you to be on the ground. Too
											often, the only time a horse sees you in the ground is when you are yelling,
											screaming as you hit the ground, and then the horse runs off from fear. This
											exercise will help the horse know, if you should end up on the ground, it is
											not a bad thing. Click here to see a video on <a

											loading your horse in a hurry. In a fire, you may need to run to a trailer
											and load your horse fast. If you have never done this your horse will get
											scared, panic and fight you. This will frustrate you and will transfer to
											the horse and put you both in a panic. Try to run your horse to your trailer
											and load him fast. It may take a few times, but once he learns he gets out
											fast once he goes in, he will not resist so much. Trying this in a fire is
											not good planning. So after you load him a few times at a walk, try it at a
											trot a few times and then try it at a run. See if you can make him run into
											the trailer from different distances and at different approaches. Every time
											you push your horse and yourself, you both grow.</p>

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>Bath Time:</u></strong> I see lots of people get
											into real trouble in this area. Horses know how to get wet, they stand in
											the rain all the time. However, getting sprayed with pressure from a hose is
											different. A horse should be sacked out with water like any other thing<img
												align="right" border="3" height="250" src="images/horsebath.jpg"
												width="250"> that is new and scares them. When giving a horse a bath,
											always spray the feet first. By wetting the legs and feet, you let the horse
											know what is coming and prepare them for what is coming. This will also help
											prevent a horse from kicking when water drips on his dry leg, which he may
											mistake for a fly or bee. So start with the feet and legs, then work up to
											the lower body, then the top and then the neck and head. I see lots of
											people say my horse doesn't like his head wet, so they never wash their
											head. Your horse will accept his head being sprayed if you do it and don't
											avoid it. Don't stop spaying a horse if he dances, moves or tries to get you
											to stop. Only stop washing him when he stands still and shows no resistance.
											The trick is to stop so fast at first that the horse does not have time to
											move. That way you work from the right answer. Too many people try and do it
											too long and then the horse moves and then they stop, teaching the wrong
											answer. Stop more and faster is the key, so the horses learn you will stop
											and there is NO reason to move or get scared. Like in all <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_training"
												target="_blank"><u>horse training</u></a>, you stop pressure when you
											get the right response, not when you get resistance. See a video on <a

											horses. They have learned that when they see a halter, they are about to be
											caught and put to work. Using a catch rope will do many things. It will make
											<strong><u>you</u></strong> learn to lead your horse without a halter, it is
											easy to conceal or just throw<img align="right" border="3"
												src="images/ropeloop.jpg"> over your shoulder and it is easy to carry
											with you while doing your chores. A catch rope can be thin or thick, a
											broken lead rope with the snap removed, or a piece of hay string. I tie
											mine, by tying the two ends together I make into one loop. This means I have
											to put it over the nose and head. It may be easier to start out with just a
											rope that is not tied. That way you can pet your horse on the shoulder and
											slide the rope around his neck without messing with the head. See a video <a

												target="_blank"><u><strong>Click Here: on how to lead your horse with a

											round pen first. This leading technique will force you to use better <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship"
												target="_blank"><u>horsemanship skills</u></a> to lead your horse. You
											will not have the advantage of a rope near the nose where you can pull or
											yank the horse around. Without this advantage, you will have to think more
											and convince, urge and encourage the horse to follow you. Later, as you get
											better you will not need the rope to lead your horse. The idea is to only
											use pressure on the rope when you need it. It is a safety catch if the horse
											stalls or stops following you. It should not just replace the lead rope and
											halter as another pulling advantage. Catching, like most things with a
											horse, is about pressure and release. If your horse follows you it gets
											release since you walk away while it follows. If the horse does not follow,
											then it has not been taught pressure and release so it does not understand
											that if it does not follow you, you will put pressure on it and make it move
											faster and work harder. Then the horse learns, not following is hard,
											following is easy.

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Slapping a horse:</strong></u> Horses don't like
											to be slapped or patted. They like rubs and scratches not pats. Think like a
											horse, when horses say hello or are relaxed, they present their head slowly,
											smell, nuzzle or scratch each other. They don't talk, they don't say good
											boy or discuss things, it is all done with body language. Give your horse a
											soft rub or scratch to help him relax and feel comfortable. Patting or
											pounding is not pleasurable to your horse. It is predatory behavior that we
											do to our dogs, which are also predators. It is hard and high pressure,
											which makes a horse uncomfortable and not want to be with you. Can you
											imagine if you were sitting in a comfortable spot, relaxing and calm and
											someone came up to you and started patting you on your neck or face. You
											would not like it and would feel uncomfortable and you would not want that
											person coming around when you were relaxing. Same thing would be if I
											offered you a lick off my ice cream cone or I said here take this and shoved
											it in your face and mouth. One way would be your choice the other would be
											me forcing it in your face.</p>

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>Show Respect when Approaching Horses</u></strong>:
											People who understand horses have a soft way to approach a horse. I see lots
											of people walk up to a horse and go right for the face, reaching, grabbing
											and very predatory. In horse talk that is rude. Horses don't just walk
											straight into the face of another horse in <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior" target="_blank"><u>the
													herd</u></a>. They make eye contact; they lower their head and
											slowly walk in almost requesting permission. Then they stop and both horses
											reach out to each other and smell or acknowledge each other, then they move
											in next to each other and rub. So when people approach a horse, if the horse
											pulls away, back up or bites or nips, it is because the person was rude.
											Watch people and you will know who understands a horse and who does not. The
											horse will tell you if you approached him politely or rudely. Of course,
											people that don't understand will blame the horse and slap them for head
											pushing or nipping, saying the horse is rude, mean or disrespectful. As I
											say a lot, the way people interact and describe horses, is really a
											description of themselves, since most horses are a reflection of how they
											are treated.</p>

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>One Rein Riding:</u></strong> Most good trainers
											will start horses with one rein. This helps the horse understand how a rein
											helps the horse turn and bend in one direction. This way the horse can only
											get one cue from the rein and is less confusing and easier for the horse to
											understand. Since a horse is mostly led around in a lead rope and halter, it
											is used to one rein, one rope, and one direction at a time. You can use this
											to get a horse to relax when you are on him for the first few times.
											However, this is a good drill to continue as you grow with your horse. I
											always say if you cannot ride a horse with a halter and single rein, then
											you should not be riding him with a bit. Doing this drill helps remind you
											to be aware of your cues. <u></u>: <a
												href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMV8JFahOHc"
												target="_blank"><u><strong>Click Here: See a video on Riding with one
														rein</strong></u></a> Since you only have one rein, you have to
											be much more aware of your seat, legs, where you are looking and body
											position. You cannot cheat, like you can with two reins and a bit, you must
											pay attention. You have to anticipate what your horse is going to do and be
											ready to give him guidance and assistance so he knows what you want. This
											will teach you how to talk to your horse softly and without pain and without
											making him do something verses showing him and requesting he do something. I
											always want to tell someone I see being rough on a horse with a bit, to try
											that with one rein and a halter and see if you can get away with it. The
											horse would teach you a quick lesson that you would not like. Ride your
											horse from time to time with just one rein, you will learn something about
											yourself and your horse. This will also teach you to use each hand
											independently. Riding with each hand working alone is better for the horse
											and sends more simple cues so the horse understands with less confusion. By
											only having one rein you cannot pull on two reins, which confuse the horse
											and braces the horse so he can learn to pull and brace against you pulling
											on two reins. This will give you confidence that you do not need a bit or
											pain to control a horse. You can really tell if your horse is neck reined
											trained when using only one rein. If he is, you will be able to make him
											turn both ways with just one rein, if you can't then he is NOT neck reined
											trained, so STOP pulling him around with two reins and thinking he is neck
											reined. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU9MeZO9FG0"

											Constant clicking and kissing for everything makes a horse ignore those
											cues. <u>Horse's don't talk with their mouth</u> for any reason. Even the
											Mares :) -- So if you talk or give a cue make it mean something. There are
											certain words that horses should only hear if you want a specific response.
											Some of these are <em>stand, whoa, walk, trot, canter, quit and come</em>.
											If you were to say these all the time and not associate them with a specific
											act, they would soon ignore these. Clicking and kissing at a horse all the
											time does the same thing. Try to make your words and sounds mean something
											together so as your horse advances you will not need both and will only need
											one. Horse's learn from consistency. Constant clicking or talking is like
											sacking out (desensitizing) a horse to your voice, you don't want this.
											Words and sounds have to mean a specific thing to a horse. If I kiss to
											move, kiss to have my horse jump, kiss to have my horse come, kiss to have
											my horse give me his foot, and so on, the horse soon learns to ignore a
											kiss. Now you have loss a verbal cue that could help your horse understand.
											I see so-called & "know it all " horse people who use words for everything.
											They do things like say Step, when a horse walks over something or they Move
											when a horse moves or they Ear when a horse moves his ear, or they Left when
											a horse's left hoof hits the ground or they say Gate when a horse goes in a
											gate, or trailer when a horse is by a trailer, almost as if they really
											think the horse knows what they are saying. Horses just ignore your words if
											you never stop talking. One word, one sound means one thing. Remember the
											KISS method (Keep It Simple Stupid). This is just another example on why
											talking to a horse all the time makes him ignore you and your voice. Horses
											don't talk, they communicate with <a

											grooming a horse many things are happening that most do not realize.
											Bonding, relationship building, establishing leadership, being accepted by
											your horse, learning to read your horse, discovering your horse's muscles
											and bones so you know what is normal and so you will know when something is
											NOT normal. When grooming you check for injuries, pain, you desensitize your
											horse (sacking out), remove stickers, remove loose hair, remove mud, remove
											dead skin, dirt, identify sensitivity, increase circulation, you spread and
											distribute oils and it massages the horse so the horse finds comfort and
											safety when being with you. Therefore, the next time you groom, try and
											remember all the things you are teaching and all the things you should be
											learning.</p>

											was messed up, it feels funny and uncomfortable, that is how a horse feels
											if you slide the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_pad"
												target="_blank"><u>pad</u></a> against the hair. Any extra pad (pad that
											extends past the saddle) should be forward of the saddle, since when a pad

											pad in front, you prevent the pad from sliding back and ending up with the

											make extra room and it pushes the pad up into the saddle gullet. This keeps
											the pad off the back, off the mane hair and off the withers. It is being

											and move sideways at night more than during the day. Horses see more at
											night then we do, so they will see things before us and we have less time to
											react. Since you can't see as well as your horse, and can't see the ground,
											your balance is not as good as during the day. If your horse does buck for
											some reason, jump quickly, or spook, you have a much better chance of
											staying in the saddle and keeping your balance if you have this strap. A
											night latch is a piece of leather, much like a dog collar, which is secured
											to your gullet, next to your saddle horn and can be used as a handle when
											the ride gets rough. You can watch my video where I explain and show this by

											The rope one is called a cowboy night latch and can be made with a lead
											rope. Soft rope makes a nice handle. I can't say how many times this has
											saved me. Had I known this years ago, I would have a lot less falls under my
											belt. This helps the horse from learning bad lessons (it a horse gets you
											out of a saddle), by you staying in the saddle, the horse does not learn he
											can get rid of you when he wants. This has another very important benefit.
											If one hand is in the nightlatch then you can't be pulling on both reins
											(BAD) when the ride gets rough. Anytime a horse spooks, bucks or runs off,
											one rein is used to get control or to regain control NEVER TWO reins. An
											easy way to always remember this is "<strong>One rein you live, Two reins
												you die</strong>". Since you are only using one rein anyway, you have a
											free hand and if that hand is in a nightlatch, you and your horse have a
											much better chance of success. Some say that the nightlatch was invented by
											old cowboys who rode many hours and would tap naps or go to sleep while the
											horse walked home, since horses always know the way home.</p>

												src="images/leading.jpg" width="256"> teach your horse to follow you and
											respond to you rather than to feel he is always in a tug of war with you.
											Soft hands make soft horses, hard hands make hard horses. A lead rope should
											be used as a suggestion cue and not as a pull rope. Notice others holding
											their horses, many people feel the need to hang on the area where the lead
											rope attaches to the halter. This is annoying to a horse and will cause him
											to ignore pulls and changes in pressure to his halter. The less you move,
											pull or hang on the halter, the more the horse will pay attention when you
											use it as a cue. Don't hang, pull, tug, fiddle, swing or mess with your lead
											rope or reins. These are used to give a cue not for you to annoy the horse
											or occupy your idol or nervous hands. When leading your horse try and lead
											it with no rope. Try and put your hand under the chin and <img align="left"
												border="3" height="250" src="images/boy.jpg" width="250">on the opposite
											cheek of the horse. If you lead your horse like this with a rope, soon you
											will not need a rope. Another way is to place your hand on the withers while
											leading your horse on a lead rope, soon your horse will learn to walk with
											you if you place your hand on his withers. You should also try and lead your
											horse with other things. Try and lead with your belt or shirt around his
											neck, a hay string or other string. Never pull a horse straight, you can't
											do it, he will learn to pull and you will lose. Always pull and release at
											an angle so you take away the horse's ability to pull straight back. You can
											tell someone who does not understand a horse when they continue to pull
											straight on a horse until they cause the horse to rear and they say their
											horse NEEDS a stud chain. Leading is about getting a horse to follow you
											without pulling it. Less is more. The photo above and left is a <a

											when you accidentally drop your rope and your horse steps on it, you will
											not get a blow up or run away. Remember to use a rope halter with no snaps

											weekend or a few times a month. After about a 1000 rides you can consider
											your horse broke. I hear horses for sale that say "three year old, dead
											broke", BS. No such thing as a dead broke horse at three. In order to get a
											1000 rides on a horse, if you ride a horse every day for three years you
											will get a 1000 rides. If you ride a horse twice a day for two years you
											will get 1000 rides. If you are like most people and only ride two times a
											week, it will take you 10 years to get a thousand rides in. The number of
											rides is not the only thing that is important, it is how long the rides are,
											what you are doing and how well you are doing it. Therefore, with all those
											factors, the odds of getting a well trained and well broke horse under six
											years old is very rare. Now, with that in mind, that is only considering the
											horse. What about you? How many actual rides do you have under your belt?
											What did you do on those rides? Were you just sitting or were you actively
											driving and learning? So even if you have a horse with a 1000 rides, if you
											only have 100 rides, it will not take long for the horse to know this. So be

											find it hard to believe what I see people doing with horses. It just
											confirms why so many injuries are blamed on horses when really people cause
											them. I just saw a rider, while sitting on a horse, allow <u>another
												person</u> to remove the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridle"
												target="_blank"><u>headstall and reins</u></a> and then replace the
											headstall with another bit and reins. For about 30 seconds, this rider was
											sitting on a horse with means to control it in an open area. Had this been
											done in a round pen or enclosed arena, it would not have been as dangerous,
											but still unwise. Since it was done in an open area with cars, trailers,
											other riders, motorcycles, planes and other distractions, it was extremely
											dangerous and risky. It would have been very easy for something to spook
											this horse (a bee sting) and cause this horse to jump, run off or move
											quickly. Had this happened, the horse would have quickly learned that he was
											free and the rider had no reins or no lead rope to control him. This would
											have made the horse more insecure, what could have been a small spook, and
											jump is now a scared horse that thinks his rider is giving him no direction
											and no help and now he is on his own. So what do you think would happen
											next, the horse would run, since his instincts would take over and he would
											be more scared. Then the rider would be scared, rightfully so, and she would
											probably scream, yell and panic, squeeze with her legs, this would increase
											the fear the horse was already feeling and would only cause him to run
											faster and with greater fear and possibly run blind. Since many riders use
											their reins for balance, the odds are the rider would fall off or jump off.
											And of course everyone would blame the "Crazy" horse for all these problems.
											The point is, don't ever let anyone remove your headstall, reins or other
											means of control, while you are on a horse, it is dangerous and foolish and
											only sets the horse up to get blamed when it goes bad. When you take all
											head control off a horse, you can expect that he may walk off, run off or
											start to move, no matter how well he is trained. No training takes out all
											fear and spooks from a horse. So a horse can spook at any time, under any
											conditions, so don't be shocked when it happens, expect it and plan for it,
											so when it happens it won't be such a surprise. This could have easily been
											avoided by simply getting off the horse and then getting back on. Even
											putting a lead rope on the horse before removing the headstall would be
											better, but don't risk it. Get off your horse if you need to change a <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridle"
												target="_blank"><u>headstall</u></a> and make sure anyone you care about
											does the same.</p>

											fear were commonly used to train horses. If a horseman is good enough and
											understands the horse, he will need spurs on all horses. Unfortunately, most
											riders who wear them never get good enough to get rid of them. They more
											worried about looking rough and tough than caring for the horse. Not so long
											ago, so called horsemen would sharpen their spurs and tips to make the horse
											more responsive. But many people that use them would say "it does not hurt
											the horse if you know how to use them "or they say" I don't use them unless
											I have to ", or they say," If you use them right they will not hurt the
											horse." If you know how to understand the horse, you will normally not need
											them. If you allow someone to use them on your horse, soon your horse will
											not respond to anyone that is not wearing them. On the flip side, yes they
											can be used as an effective aide to give more specific cues to specific

											was meant for a reason. Giving an inexperienced rider spurs only hurts them
											and the horse. By earning your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spur"
												target="_blank"><u>spurs</u></a>, you put in ride time, you learn how to
											talk and communicate with a horse without them, you learn how to get a horse

											strap them on. Unfortunately, the opposite is true today and people who wear

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Hot Wires</strong></u>: Spend some time with your
											horse and hot wires so they understand them. Too many people just put up a
											hot wire and think a horse will figure it out, not so. If you do not
											introduce the horse to the wire and help him understand to move away from
											the shock, you will set the horse up for failure. When a horse gets his
											first shock from a wire, he will most likely panic and run into it, in an
											attempt to get away from pain. After he does this a few times, he will learn
											that by running through the hot wire, the pain is stopped and now you have a
											horse that only knows one way to deal with hot wires. Then you can be like
											so many others and blame the horse for not knowing what to do and being hard
											headed, when in fact, it was your fault for not showing the horse how to
											move back away from the wire. Hot wires are cheats; they use pain and fear
											to train a horse. I don't like them and think they are mean. I see people
											put them around their stalls to keep their horse "safe". This makes a horse
											nervous and always on guard when moving, trying to make sure he does not get
											shocked. A stall is bad enough, at least a horse should be able to feel safe
											in it. Hot wires are just another cruel method and shortcut used to control
											horses with fear and pain.</p>

											looks sore, his hoof is chipped, it is too windy, too many people are
											around, the tractor is working and <img align="left" border="3"

											one or two days. Saddle up, even if you just sit on your horse and talk or
											walk to get the mail. Little short rides teach the horse that not every time
											you saddle he gets his ass rode off. Short pleasant rides, where the horse
											is not worked that hard are great for you and the horse. No pressure, no
											fuss or frustration and spend some time in the saddle. So stop making
											excuses and ride your horse. For most people it takes seven years for them
											to get one year's ride time on their horse. Short rides teach a horse that

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Allowing or Stopping:</strong></u> You want a
											horse to think you let or allowed him to do something, not that he made you
											release pressure. Knowing this difference is huge and you can bet the horse
											knows the difference. Stopping a horse from doing something is the same as
											making him do something. If I stop his forward movement, I have exerted
											dominance and told him I control his movement. If I make him give me his
											leg, I have stopped him from standing on all four feet and take away his
											ability to run. So let's take eating on the trail. If I allow a horse to
											eat, then when I stop him from eating, he is submitting to me, when I am
											asking, and he stops eating. You are always teaching a horse. If you stand
											around and pull or hang on a horse's lead rope then you teach him to ignore
											pressure from the lead rope, if you always pull or keep your reins tight,
											then you teach him to ignore pressure from the reins. Your ability to make a
											horse feel no pressure is as important as your ability to make a horse feel
											pressure. You being aware of it is the key. Horse riding is not a spectator
											sport. Awareness is the key to knowing what you are doing, what your horse
											is doing and how to change both.

											for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle"
												target="_blank"><u>saddling</u></a> up your horse before you ride. This
											lets the horse know what to expect and creates GOOD habits. I like to tie
											him up, pick his feet, brush him down, saddle him up, stretch his front
											legs, flex him on each side, tighten the cinch at least three times, lunge
											him once or twice each direction and make him stop, then mount and sit for a
											few seconds so he learns to wait and not walk off as soon as I get on. This
											tells me alot about my horse. I can tell if he shows any pain or sensitivity
											while brushing or picking his feet, I can tell any resistance when picking
											his feet, flexing or stretching his front legs, when lunging I can see if he
											is paying attention and listening to me. All of this will set you and your
											horse up for a safe ride. What I see most people do is rush, rush, rush,
											throw the saddle on, cinch up once as tight as they can, be rough with the
											horse by pushing him around, force the saddle and bit, and then jump on and
											immediately take off. This sets up bad habits and if your horse has any

											<strong>Flies control is important -</strong> Flies seek shade in the heat

											NOT treated or helped with fly control, the horse will stand in the sun to
											help keep the flies off them - the problem then becomes a horse will roast
											in the sun, dehydrate and can get heat stroke, sunburn or heat exhaustion
											trying to keep flies off them. This is the same reason flies gather under
											the horse's belly, they seek shade and know the horse can't use their tail
											to show them off. Horses with excessive flies tend to have other health
											issues, like worms, lack of proper food or minerals or some other sickness.

											sting and leaving it around the bale creates problems. When feeding at night

											it, but they can accidentally eat it as it is mixed up with the hay and once

											immediately tie all three hay strings (since my bales of hay all have three
											strings) together so it makes a big knot and is harder to misplace one
											string. That way when I grab one I have all three. This ties into checking
											the hay you are feeding your horses, you need to check for glass, nuts and

											front feet and if you do the back feet, don't turn your horse out with other
											horses. If you have a choice, don't allow others to turn their horses out if
											the horse has rear shoes. Another note on shoes, they cause fires. Ever ride
											at night and watch a horse with shoes; they will spark as they hit rocks and
											gravel. So if a bunch of horses are in a dry pasture and start running or
											playing, a fire can start pretty easy. Just one more reason not to have

											people out there claim to be a Farrier. In the olden days, people remember a
											<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier"
												target="_blank"><u>Farrier</u></a> was called a Blacksmith. The word
											Blacksmith comes from black metals that turn black when heated (iron) and
											smith comes from the word smite which means to hit. Hence heating iron and
											pounding it to shape. Blacksmiths mainly made weapons and tools and later
											moved to horse shoeing. As people learned more about the horse's foot things
											changed. Even today the angle of<img align="right" border="3" height="250"
												src="images/farrier.jpg" width="250"> hooves are debated. Farrier school
											takes about a year to complete and concentrates on hooves. Angles, anatomy,
											neglect, fixing problems, mistakes and most topics related to hoof care are
											taught. So if a person calls himself a Farrier, he should have some
											education behind him to prove this. Some of the old timers may have been
											doing horses feet for 30 or 40 years, but never have had any formal
											education. Not a bad thing since they have many years of first hand
											experience. Owning a horse will require you to use someone for your horse's
											feet. So knowing the difference may help. One Farrier told me that the
											difference between a horse shoer and a Farrier is: A Farrier is who you call
											after a horse shoer messes up your horses feet. Made me laugh, but there may
											be some truth to that. Be aware how to tell if the person working on your
											horse's feet knows what they are doing. Always watch them work on your
											horse. Ask questions and learn something from each visit. Confirm things you
											are told from other horse owners and other Farriers. Research things on the
											net to get different viewpoints and to see what information is out there to
											help you learn. I like to watch for clues. What clues do you ask? Does this
											Farrier own horses, is he known, what is his reputation, does he explain
											things, is he gentle, does he hit horse's with his tools, does he use a gum
											line, does he use a twitch, is he on time, does he answer his phone, does he
											keep his appointments, does he tell stories about how many bad horses he has
											beat to make them behave, and so on. Don't be afraid to tell your shoer NOT
											to hit your horse. If you are there, you can enforce this no hit policy. On
											the other hand, if you have not spent the time to train your horse, don't be
											surprised if your Farrier does not return your calls and does not want you
											as a client. If you pick your horse's feet daily, your horse will behave
											much better for the Farrier. If you educate yourself about horse's feet, you
											will know when a Farrier is packing sand or being honest. HINT: <a

												src="images/sweaty.jpg" width="250">working them when they are wet. This
											is a sign of poor horsemanship and lack of respect for your horse. When the

											can roll and itch this but it is not the same. This can affect the cooling
											system for the horse and won't let air flow until the horse gets wet again
											from more sweat. Is it critical or life threatening, no, but it reflects
											poorly on you. Be kind and help your horse out, give him a good rinse after
											he sweats, it cools him, removes the sticky salts and feels good. It also

												width="140"> their horse from rolling. I don't get what the big deal is
											if a horse rolls and gets some dirt on them. I go as far as throwing dirt on
											my horse if he cannot roll. A horse rolls to itch his skin, to remove dry
											skin, to fluff their hair, to spread oils or to coat themselves in dirt or
											mud. Where insects are bad a good roll in the mud will put a layer on a
											horse to prevent bugs from biting, stinging or annoying them. Remember a
											horse can shake a fly off their butt, their skin is extremely sensitivity.
											So if your horse wants to roll, think like a horse, your horse may have good
											reasons for wanting to roll, so let him enjoy a good roll after a hose down.
											Believe me, whatever dirt he gets on him, you can brush off the next day
											with ease.</p>

											bird poop and other contaminants left over from the birds. If you do not
											clean these buckets each time, your horse will ingest these and other
											bacteria. This is NOT good for your horse's health. If you must leave your
											buckets out or must feed out of a bucket that was left out, it is better to
											wash and clean the bucket with some bleach or other disinfectant. In a
											pinch, you can put dirt or some hay in the bucket and scrub the bucket with

											for slack and the horse never gets complete release from pressure. I see
											this more with women. Which is why I think it is a security and confidence
											thing. For some reason, if someone has short reins they feel more in<img
												align="right" border="3" height="99" src="images/reins2.jpg"
												width="127"> control and think they have more control over the horse.
											The opposite is true. The fact that you cannot feel in control with loose
											reins shows that you are not a confident rider and are not relaxed in the
											saddle. The horse knows this and will normally feel the same way. A
											confident rider will know that the bit or short reins will not control a
											horse. Understanding and trusting the horse and yourself will control a
											horse. I like having people who ride with short reins ride with a rope and a
											halter. This teaches you to control the horse with only one rein, the lead
											rope and to control the horse with just a halter. This builds confidence in
											horse and rider. It also teaches a rider to control the horse with each hand
											and not to try and "neck" rein a horse. Neck reining is confusing to a
											horse, normally because most people don't really understand the concept of
											neck reining. A horse needs clear cues and direction. You do that by direct
											reining and not by neck reining. Do your horse a favor, learn to ride in
											loose reins with slack, your horse will be calmer and will learn to pay more
											attention to your reins than if you use short reins where your horse is
											annoyed and learns to ignore your reins movements.</p>

											off when mounting or taking a step forward after a halt. If the horse is
											giving a low-level test, do not correct with a high-level reaction. If a
											horse walks off after you told him to stop, think and calmly back him up a
											few steps. This does not have to be aggressive, loud or with kicking and
											hard reins pulls. Just simply recognize the test and direct the response
											appropriately. You can back a horse with soft hands and without kicks and
											yells and get the same result only better. Don't use a sledgehammer to kill
											a fly.<strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius"

											overcome the resistance, not over kill with running, yelling, rough head
											yanks and pulls or backing with a tight bit. All of this aggression takes
											away from the learning part of the correction. When you go overboard, your
											horse is not learning, he is reacting, so he will not be sure what the
											lesson is. If you slow down and be more calm, the horse will understand the
											lesson and will learn from it. So don't back a horse 30 feet for taking one
											step forward. Make him get a good headset, have him step back two or three
											steps and release. If he submits then you did right, if he resists, then you
											may need to work on this later or change what you are doing. Getting your
											horse to submit to you, with the least amount of pressure, is your goal.
											Every time he submits, he tells you OK I see you as the higher horse. So do
											this without telling him that you are an aggressive predator on his back.
											Remember, he is your partner not your slave. :) Less is always better. So
											always try and get a result with as least pressure as needed, that way your

											and you prevent a correction. By having <strong>soft hands</strong> or also
											called <strong>quiet hands</strong>, you can feel when your horse is pulling
											or trying to go off in one direction, by directing the horse back to the
											right direction, you prevent letting him get too far and then correcting him
											to the right direction. So if you horse tries to bite another horse and then
											you snap the reins, yell at him, back him up or make a huge deal about it, I
											say it was your fault for not knowing he was about to bite and did not give
											him direction before he actually did bite. Take responsibility for what your
											horse does and stop blaming the horse because you failed to pay attention,
											you failed to see the warning signs, you were not in tune enough with your
											horse to read what he was going to do and did not prevent him from doing it.
											Keep your hands quiet when handling reins, your horse will become more
											responsive and you will become more aware how little you really have to move
											your reins and still have control of your horse.</p>

										<p align="justify"><strong><u>Problems on the Way to Barn:</u></strong> I see
											lots of people try and work on problems on the way back to the barn. Some
											problems can be worked on and other should not be worked on. Most problems
											do not occur overnight or in one ride. So way do so many people try and fix
											running and pulling on one ride back to barn. We have all done it. You get
											tired, you get in a hurry, your horse gets excited, he starts pushing and
											pulling and you start showing him "who is boss", then you end up in a fight
											all the way home. After time the horse leans to expect this and as soon as
											you head home, they know they are about to get into a fight, so they get
											more upset, more excited, more high-headed and are actually getting ready
											for the fight they know is about to come. So then we react and it goes
											downhill from there. I know it is easier said than done, but try and keep
											your return calm, fun and relaxing. Not to mention that other riders don't
											want to see you fight with your horse. When you get upset and fight with
											your horse, you upset the other horses, you make other horses nervous and
											may cause others to have problems with their horses. I bet we all have heard
											or seen where all the horses were just "Bad " on the way back to the barn.
											Horses are herd animals, when they see another horse getting his butt
											whipped, they know. When I have to have a horsy to horsy discussion with my
											horse, I don't like doing it around lots of people. When no one is watching,
											the ego factor goes way down. Ego is one the worst things that interferes
											with training your horse. Remember having a horse is about a loving caring
											relationship with your partner, it is not all about being in charge, being
											right, controlling every detail and teaching the horse who is boss all the
											time. If you were a horse, wouldn't you like to get back to the barn so you
											could eat, get that saddle and 150 pounds off your back, get that hot saddle
											and tight cinch off and be in a safe environment with your friends? Of
											course you would, so try and understand what your horse is thinking when you
											respond or react to his behavior. This does not mean allow your horse to run
											back, but try and deal with it from a horse's point of view. I assure you,
											your horse is not saying: OK, here we go, this is where I get to piss off
											mom or dad, watch this, I will start ignoring them and they will get pissed,
											I stop paying attention and watch me get them mad, bla bla bla. That is
											something people would do, but not a horse. Sometimes watching people
											respond to their horse, I really think people believe their horse is
											actually thinking like this, it ain't so. Your horse is just being a horse.
											Give him direction and so you do not have to give correction.</p>

											big difference between riding a horse and understanding a horse. I am always
											suspicious when someone starts telling me how they rode horses all the time
											as a kid. Sitting on a horse may be riding, but you are not
											communicating<img align="right" border="3" height="250"
												src="images/fearhorse.jpg" width="250"> and you don't have a
											understanding about how a horse thinks or why a horse is what it is. Until
											you study the horse (which most do not), you cannot know what you need to
											know to understand a horse. So people may have owned or ridden horses for 20
											years, yet they still only have maybe one year of experience 20 times. I
											have these types of people come up to me when I am working with my horse and
											tell me what I should be doing. I have had people reach over and grab my
											horse by the halter when I am holding the lead rope. I have had people
											adjust my equipment while I am in the saddle. People do this thinking they
											are helping and it is very impolite and dangerous. If you really understand
											a horse, then you will know and will wait for someone to ask you. And they
											will, they may not listen to what you tell them, but they will ask. The ones
											that want to tell you how, what to do with your horse, are not being asked
											for a reason, and that is why they have this need to volunteer. Real
											experienced horsemen do not need to tell someone what they know, you can see
											it in the way they handle their horses and the way their horse's respond to
											them. The real judge of a good horseman is the Horse!</p>

											horses have a<img align="right" border="3" height="250"

											it will keep their coat clean and healthy. And don't stop or prevent them
											from rolling. Horses love to roll in the dirt after they get wet. This
											itches the skin, massages the dry skin, distributes the oils and creates a
											nice sunscreen and bug protection. After a horse rolls the dirt that sticks
											like mud will help keep flies off, will help the horse not feel the flies,
											and will prevent mosquitoes from biting. So a dirty horse is good. So what

											times you asked. I think you should always ask nicely at first but then you
											have to turn up the heat. Some say the difference between a good horse and a
											great horse is how it is asked to do something. Some believe that if I ask
											nicely and you don't get your horse to respond then you just bought some
											trouble hard and fast. Others believe that you ask several times with
											increasing pressure until you get the proper response. I think somewhere in
											between is fine. If my horse knows something good and I know he knows it
											well, then I will only ask once and then let him know he should have
											responded to my request. However, if he is slow or worried or paying
											attention to something else, then I will give a couple of requests and try
											to get the horse to respond to me. I never want to fight or look for a fight
											with my horse, which only teaches a horse to fight and fear me. So I am
											always searching on how to set my horse up for success and to get my result
											with the least amount of pressure or resistance. I can always get aggressive
											and scare my horse to move, that is not <a
												href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship"
												target="_blank"><u>good horsemanship</u></a>. My goal should be to
											remove fear and never to create it. Pain = fear, fear = reactions, reactions
											do not = learning. I find that the louder and more vocal a rider or handler
											is, the less they understand a horse. Talking and explaining to a horse does
											nothing for the horse, it is normally done to try and justify what is being
											done to the horse and is done for other people watching. <strong>The best
												horsemen get results quietly, calmly and with hardly no
												movements.</strong> When people look and wonder how the horse knows what
											to do since they can't see the rider doing much, that is the sign of a
											horseman. When you see yelling, yanking on the bit, screaming, kicking, and
											flopping in the saddle, that is not good horsemanship and normally confuses
											the horse and makes the horse nervous and scared and creates a fear

											tell me all the time how they put plastic bags and other scary things in
											their horse's stall, since their horse is scared of them. This is not a good
											way to sack out a horse. If you sack out a horse you want to be able to
											apply pressure and remove pressure when the horse gives the right response.
											When putting things in stalls, you cannot remove or control the pressure.
											You are just creating fear for your horse and your horse does not learn. He
											may eventually learn to ignore the scary items you force him to live with.
											In addition, in his stall, this may work, but once he runs into the scary
											object outside the stall, he will still have fear. The stall technique will
											not build trust between you and him and will not accomplish what you hope.
											Think about it, if you were deathly afraid of snakes, so I decided to put
											several snakes in your bedroom and lock the door. Would that really help
											your fear of snakes? No, it would make you think I was a jerk, it would make
											you not like your bedroom, it would make it so you could not relax in your
											bedroom and would cause you not to like being in your bedroom. A horse
											already dislikes being locked up and stalled; you really don't need to make
											him dislike it more. Once again, this is "cheat" and a shortcut and that
											rarely works with horses. When you take the time to work with your horse, to
											teach it to trust you, you show the horse that if he stands still, you will
											make the scary thing go away. You show the horse that you will not hurt it
											and if he trusts you, you will keep him safe. You show the horse that you
											understand him and you know when he gets too scared so you can make the
											scary thing go away and he can relax and take a break. You show him that you
											control the scary thing. You show him that as long as the horse does not
											react, you will make the scary thing release pressure. All of this will help
											you learn your horse, will teach you to read your horse better and will
											develop a bond with you and your horse. So if you are not concerned with
											helping your horse go ahead and park a tractor in his stall to "teach him a
											lesson" for being scared of a tractor.</p>

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Horse Eating Straw:</strong></u> I will say it
											again in case you missed it the other 10 times I mentioned it. Too much time
											in a stall is not good for horses. Some people use straw for beddings. The
											three most common bedding being used is straw, shavings or pellets. Each has
											good and bad points. Shavings (sawdust) remove moisture from the feet more
											and can cause dust (respiratory) problems for some horses, but soaking up
											urine really good. Straw does not absorb urine as well, but is easier to
											remove and makes better bedding (cushioning) for the horse and tends to be
											cheaper. Straw is more natural and if a horse eats some with his food, it
											<img align="left" border="3" height="93" src="images/straw.jpg"
												width="124">will not kill him. However, some horses want to eat the
											straw like hay (I think this is from boredom or hunger). Straw is the
											by-product (dry stalk) of cereal plants (barley, oat, rice, rye, wheat).
											Since straw is dry and can be sharp it can cause injuries to the nose and
											eyes it poked the wrong way. Straw is fed to cattle as a roughage
											supplement. As it digests in the gut, it creates heat and keeps them warm.
											Concerns with straw are it is dry and can cause or contribute to impaction
											colic. So you do NOT want to use it as a primary food source and you should
											probably limit it from a horse's diet. Some things I have heard to help stop
											horses from eating straw is, you can put wet (urine soaked) straw on top of
											your other straw. The horse will not normally eat wet, soiled or urine
											soaked straw. Some horses develop a cough from eating straw, maybe because
											it is dry and dusty or some say it is mold spores in straw that cause it.
											Some people say straw has good fiber and no calories so let them eat it.
											Others say spray the straw with vinegar to stop a horse from eating it. Is a
											horse eating some straw a major problem, depends on you and your horse. It
											is something to be aware of and to keep an eye on. The less time a horse is
											in a stall with straw, the less he will eat it. I think if you are feeding
											your horse well he will not eat it, since it is hard and not as good as
											other hay you are feeding. However, if locked up in a stall for too long, a
											horse will chew wood, chew poles, wind suck, crib, sway or eat straw out of
											boredom. If you don't feed your horse for 12 to 24 hours and a horse gets
											hungry, they will eat most anything to stay alive. If you use straw, feed
											your horse and keep him out of stall as much as possible.

												border="3" height="250" src="images/highline1.jpg" width="250"> you have
											to teach it and expose the horse to it before just doing it. I have put a
											drawing of some knots to help set up a picket line. High Lining is nothing
											more than tying your horse high. The problem is when a horse has not been
											taught to tie well and is a puller. If a horse pulls a high line, it shakes
											and moves the line, which ALL horses will feel that are tied to the line. A
											horse has to be taught that the line moving is no big deal. Other ways to
											secure a horse is to make a temporary pen with rope around four trees. This
											would have to be taught as well or the horse would over, under or through
											it. You can use hobbles if your horse has been trained to accept them or you
											can do what is called ground tying. Ground tying is tying your horse to a
											stump, log or by burying the rope in a hope and pounding dirt over it with
											your heel. Of course your horse has to know how to not step on the rope, how
											to NOT panic if the rope gets around his legs and to give to the pressure of
											the rope. As you can tell, no matter what method you use, you have to put
											time in to prepare the horse for success and to protect the horse from
											itself.</p>

											Some say this is caused by not having all the testicular tissue removed by
											the person that gelded the horse. I think it also has to do with how old the
											horse was when he was gelded. The longer a horse remains a Stud, the more
											traits he will keep after he is finally cut. Testosterone is produced and
											this can be an additional factor for this behavior. Some people say this
											behavior can be caused by an overactive adrenal gland. No matter the cause,

											think this is done to teach the foal to respect the mom and to claim the

											will see horses standing shoulder to shoulder, facing each other's butt.
											They will groom each other in areas that they cannot reach alone. This is
											just another example <img align="left" border="3" height="250"

											of the time the two horses doing this will be either buddies or close in
											ranking within the herd. You will not see the herd leader grooming the
											lowest ranking horse, unless there are only two or three horses in the herd.
											So when you groom your horse, realize this. By grooming your horse, you
											stimulate herd behavior and build a herd bond with your horse. However, you
											must be aware that your horse, being a horse, will try and return the favor
											and may try and groom you. This is not bad, mean or aggressive. He is just
											being a good herd mate. So please don't over react and slap him, hit him,
											accuse him of trying to bite you, beat him for putting his teeth on you. You
											can let him know, thanks but no thanks. Moving your elbow or hand, making a
											blocking move, or pushing on his nose and telling him no, will send a
											message you don't want him to groom you. Don't ruin his bonding experience

											winter when it is<img align="right" border="3" height="250"
												src="images/friends.jpg" width="250"> cold and the water is cold, horses
											do not drink as much. This can cause impaction colic or dehydration. A horse
											will not break ice to get to water (normally) and will not eat snow to get
											it either. There are many ways to keep water from icing over. Many people
											use heaters to warm water, even if you don't have really cold temps, you can
											still warm the water to encourage a horse to drink and to help him stay
											warm. A nice old way is to use old tires. If you stack three or four tires
											(all the way to the top of the water bucket) and stuff the tires with straw,
											the water will not ice over. The straw or hay insulates the bucket and
											prevents the water from freezing. Remember not to neglect your horse in the
											winter even if it is cold, wet, rainy, windy or whatever else is there. Your
											horse needs you more and is relying on you for his feed, warmth, food and
											water.</p>

												src="images/alfalfacubes.jpg" width="137"> calcium can throw off mineral
											balances which can cause tying up in some horses. Too much protein can cause
											a list of other problems. Alfalfa was developed for dairy cows that produce
											milk and needed this high energy feed. Then the racing horse crowd thought
											it would be good to feed the race horses since they are run too much and too
											young. Then some how other horse people bought <img align="left" border="3"
												height="250" src="images/alfalfaflake.jpg" width="250">into this and now
											alfalfa seems to be the hay of choice in many places. Growers love it since
											they can get 6 to 8 cuttings per year. If you feed it, the later the cuts
											the better, first, second and third cuts are still a little rich for horses.
											It is better to use alfalfa as a partial feed and not a primary feed. It is
											not a grass hay and causes more colic than grass hay. The pellets have more
											consistency and may be better but the cubes can choke a horse and cause a
											horse to eat too fast, not chew as well and not digest as well. A variety of
											hay is best for the horse, some rye, some oat, some grass and some alfalfa
											will help a horse get a variety of vitamins and minerals and keeps their

											position. Cutting the nerve endings in a tail so it will not swish during

											where people set horses up for failure. I heard of this rescue place where
											people were not allowed to talk around the horses and anyone coming to see a
											horse must whisper <img align="left" border="3" height="301"
												src="images/pinto.jpg" width="300">so not to disturb or upset the
											horses. Then this person was told by staff at this rescue place that the
											horse may not want to come of it's stall today, so you may have to come back
											to see the horse another time. This is so bad for the horses. Basically,
											these horses are being taught to expect whispers and total quiet, so they
											are being set up for failure. When someone talks normal or moves normal or
											something unplanned happens, these horses will be scared and will react with
											fear. This is the same thing that happens when people sneak around a horse
											with a saddle, plastic bag or other things. You can't protect horses from
											life, so don't try. Flop straps on your saddle routinely, let the stirrups
											flop around, drop buckets, drop the lead rope, toss your hat at your horse's
											feet, drag the hose across his legs, throw your jacket over his neck, drop
											the rake, bump him with a gate, roll the wheel barrel into him and anything
											that you think might scare him, do it as a matter of routine. Soon your
											horse will think when you are<img align="right" border="3" height="276"
												src="images/horse.jpg" width="200"> around crazy things happen, soon he
											will ignore these crazy things, soon he will not react to much when he is
											with you and soon you will have a horse that does not spook much and ignores
											most things. This sets the horse up for success. Since you can't control
											everything on a trail ride, in an arena or other people, getting your horse
											to expect and accept strange things helps him deal with other unplanned
											things that he will inevitably be exposed to at some time. After your horse
											gets good at accepting anything you throw at him, it will become a challenge
											for you to find things to make him react, then you can go on search missions
											to try and find something new to get him to react, it will get harder and
											harder to find things. So don't be too gentle and protective that you set
											your horse up for failure. The picture of the rocks, snow and paint horses

											seen where people do not clean their feed containers and over time, within a
											few months, there are lots of small rocks and pebbles at the bottom, then
											grain is fed in this same container and the horse has to shift through the
											rocks and pebbles. This is not good for the horse in a few ways, you don't

											people<img align="right" border="3" height="150" src="images/phone.jpg"
												width="124"> are doing all this what they are not doing is paying
											attention to their horse. A horse knows what is going to happen before it
											happens. Why, that is how they stay alive, if they stop paying attention
											they get eaten, injured or die. It is that simple for a horse. So unless
											they know you are paying attention they will not relax, in fact they will
											get nervous, tense and insecure. Horsemen will always be in touch, reading
											or in tune with their horse. It becomes second nature over time. After years
											of riding, practice and picking yourself up off the ground, you learn the
											importance of this. Watch other people, if you see someone disciplining
											their horse, I almost bet they were involved in a conversation, talking to
											someone and NOT paying attention to their horse. So the horse moved, walked
											off or did not listen and BANG, the rider Blamed the Horse! I have done it
											and see it done way too often, it is not fair to the horse. If you pay
											attention to your horse, you will know when he is about to do something and
											you can prevent it with guidance and direction rather than letting him do it
											and then correcting or blaming him for it. Be a responsible partner and be
											fair to your horse.</p>

											teeth by youngsters is normal baby talk behavior. It is done by young horses
											to show submission, to acknowledge their lower position and to communicate
											that they are not a threat. They will normally lower their head and <img
												align="left" border="3" height="118" src="images/foal&#32;clacking.JPG"
												width="191">stretch their neck out to further demonstrate their
											non-threatening intentions. I have heard that submissive females will "teeth
											clack" when mating with a donkey. I have only seen young horses do this
											behavior or even an older horse that is meeting a new horse and wants to be
											friends will sometimes clack their teeth as a way to be non-threatening and
											to say, "hey I just want to be friends, don't hurt me. When babies exhibit
											this behavior they will sometimes also do the Flehmen response, curling the
											lip, raising the head and showing teeth, this action allows the smell to
											reach chemical receptors in the roof of the mouth. So if a horse clacks his
											teeth at you, they are not being aggressive, in fact it is the opposite,
											they are being submissive and requesting your permission to be friends.</p>

											but need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"
												target="_blank"><u>water</u></a> to survive. If you are working your
											horse in hot weather, stop and give him a drink at least every half-hour.
											Adding ice to your horse's water will often encourage them to drink. Be sure
											your horse's water is in the shade. If you place water buckets in the direct
											<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" target="_blank"><u>sun,</u></a>
											the water can get so hot that your horse can't drink it and he could scald
											his lips. You can wear a hat, wipe your face and neck with a cool wet cloth.
											Your horse can't wear a hat, but you can wet their head and face or sponge
											it off with cool water. Always walk your horse to cool him down; moving
											muscles dissipate heat better than resting muscles. Make sure your horse has
											plenty of 'free choice' salt during hot weather. Most horses will sweat
											enough to need about 4 ounces of salt a day. Salt blocks won't always be
											enough, you can toss some table salt on their hay and they will eat what
											they need. If you can, stable your horse during the heat of the day and turn
											him out in the cool of the night. Without the aid of an insect repellent, a
											horse will stand in the sun to keep bugs away. If your horse has a lot of
											white on his face, use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_Oxide"
												target="_blank"><u>zinc oxide</u></a> cream to avoid a sunburned nose or
											leave it dirty and don't wash the dirt off, the dirt will act as a natural
											sun block. If traveling during hot weather, stop often and sponge the
											horse's head and neck during rest stops. You can also put wood shavings on
											the trailer floor and Wet the shavings before the trip. The damp shavings
											will help keep the horse's feet cooler. The flip side is the shavings will
											blow around and get in the horse's eyes and nose.<br>

											of the hoof and how it should work (this site won't allow it to work, so
											click on the picture to see it work). Without a shoe it can work this way,
											with a shoe it cannot. Shod horse's have more leg and tendon problems than
											non-shod horses. This is because the shoe prevents hoof movement and
											transfers all jars, bumps, slams and impacts straight from the hard shoe to
											the hoof and leg. In the old days, race cars were made of steel and were
											indestructible. This was done to protect the driver. Well what they found
											out is all the impact of a wreck was transferred to the driver since the car
											was so strong and it actually did more damage and injury to the driver.
											Which is why today, cars fall apart and are designed to consume the impact
											so the driver feels less? Same concept with shoes. When we make the hoof so
											strong and stiff with a shoe, we do more damage to the hoof and leg and
											prevent the hoof from moving and absorbing impacts. See a video <a

											sitting on a horse when it<img align="right" border="3" height="196"
												src="images/blindbuck.jpg" width="250"> happens, you will never forget
											it. Not sure what causes it and I can only guess. I think when a horse is
											pushed too hard, too fast, scared really bad, exposed to extreme pain and
											not prepared properly, this so-called phenomenon happens. I have seen it at
											race tracks, at rodeos and in arenas. A horse gets so scared or feels so
											much pain, he goes into a crazy buck or a wild run and will run through a
											fence, off a cliff or into the side of a building. It is almost as if the
											horse goes blind and can't see anything because of the pain and or fear.
											There is no stopping a horse that has transformed into this mode. He is
											overcome with fear, feels no pain, is in a panic flight mode, and will not
											normally stop until he wrecks, crashes or flips over to the ground. Can you
											prevent this, not sure, but I think you can see the signs that it may happen
											and help prevent it. With proper sacking out techniques, good desensitizing
											and kind and humane handling, I think this will not happen. However, I have
											no proof or facts for this. You can tell a horse is in this mode by the
											inability for him to recognize you, respond to you or even acknowledge you
											if anyone else is present. This is a dangerous situation and you don't want
											to experience it.</p>

										<p align="justify"><u><strong>Twitching:</strong></u> Although I am not a fan of
											this, since like a lot things, if done appropriately, can be helpful and
											when abused do more damage. So I post this with mixed emotions. I can only
											hope that if you are reading my site, you are trying to learn more about
											horses and will not abuse them. Twitching strangely enough lowers the heart
											rate during an unpleasant procedure. A twitched horse's heart rate increases
											8%. Horses not twitched during an unpleasant procedure experience a heart
											rate increase of 22%. The experts say that twitching causes an endorphin
											release that makes unpleasant experiences less stressful. In Australia, for
											example, the handlers who load horses into racing stalls used to be allowed
											a twitch, but that was outlawed some years ago. In fact, most Aussie's think
											Americans are barbaric for still using this procedure. I stress the phrase,
											when done or used appropriately. Done properly, twitching can defuse what
											could be a dangerous situation for a horse. The physical aspect of a twitch
											is to stimulate the body to release endorphins. This is kind of like giving
											the horse opium (it gets them stoned or buzzed). It is a powerful relaxant
											and occurs naturally. One theory is some predators know this and use this to
											their benefit. When lions grab a zebra, one usually latches onto the nose.
											That isn't to shut off the air (that's done by the one at the throat), but
											to release endorphins. It is a natural preparation for death. A twitch has
											to be controlled, which means it has to be able to be released and tightened
											as the situation develops. The most common twitches are neck, ear, nose and
											gum line. The neck twitch is done with the hand and is used to simulate a
											horse bite. You will see a mommy horse disciplining their young by biting
											and holding them by the neck area. I have also seen older geldings do this
											to other horses to teach them. This neck grab will sometimes calm a horse
											and distract him enough that you can mess with an injury or give a shot. The
											ear twitch is not good or effective and I think, tends to cause a horse to
											be ear shy. The nose twitch seems to be the one of choice and it can be
											applied with the hand, rope or chain. Obviously, I don't like the stupid
											chain idea, but somewhere, a brilliant horse idiot came up with this
											revelation and decided that if a hand or rope worked then a chain would work
											better. "NEWS FLASH" - Chains and horses are BAD! So back to the hand, by
											squeezing the nose endorphins are released and the horse is relaxed and
											preoccupied with you squeezing his nose, so he is less likely to react to
											you cleaning an injury or giving him a shot. The gum line seems to be used
											by Farriers mostly. It may work but once again, there is a propensity for
											abuse or over use. A twitch is a last resort before using a tranquilizer or
											other drug. It should not be the first (easy) choice and should be used by
											EXCEPTION and not routine. (IMHO)</p>

											fault". When you are with your horse, your horse needs to see you as the
											leader. This does not mean that you just round pen it, push it around and
											move its feet and he will see you as a leader. Your horse must trust you, he
											must know that when he gets scared you will understand and not get mad at
											him or get rough with him or add to his fear. Your horse needs to always see
											you as in control, calm, strong and like nothing ever bothers you. Ever see
											a horse get scared just because he sees another horse react and get scared.
											That is what happens when your horse sees you as weak, out of control or
											fearful. So your job is to always be ready, always be prepared, always be
											calm, always act as if no matter what happens, you planned for it and wanted
											it to happen. Nothing is ever a surprise to you, you know everything. When
											your horse gets scared, you act like you planned it. You stay in control.
											You respond calmly and with smooth movements and actions. You don't get
											nervous, jumpy, scared or your horse will know. And if you do, you fake it
											that you are not. You work on controlling yourself and your actions and your
											behavior and your horse will improve and will get better. If you are worried
											about what your horse is doing or going to do, then you will not be working
											on yourself, you will not be in control, you will not be the strong leader
											your horse needs and is looking for. So always concentrate on yourself, your
											actions, your reactions, your seat, your rein control, your confidence and
											your behavior. If you do that, your horse will see you as strong, confident
											and will do better. So if you don't do that, then you cause your horse to be
											nervous, insecure and will cause him to react to you not being a strong

													Rider's Fear:</strong>

											A study conducted by the University of Guelph showed that 1/4 of rider

											study the human/animal bond, and the research results are fascinating. One
											study showed that horses' heart rate increased when their riders were
											nervous. How did they arrive at this finding? Mounted riders were told their
											horse would be blasted with water at some point while they rode. Horse heart
											rate increase matched the rider's heart rate increase. This indicates riders
											can communicate nervousness to their horses. Note: No horse/rider
											combination was ever sprayed. Horsemen have been saying this for years, and
											riders' fears run up and down the reins. Confidence instills confidence,
											nervous riders have nervous horses, fearful riders have fearful horses, a
											horse is just a reflection of their rider. As I have said many times, when a

										Slide your hand down the neck towards the shoulder blade<br>

											each offspring has to be brought to a relatively advanced (and large) state
											before birth or hatching. They are born or hatched in a condition requiring
											relatively little parental care, as by having hair, fur or feathers, open
											eyes, and the ability to move about quickly. Water birds, reptiles, and herd
											animals usually have Precocial young. Examples include antelopes, ostriches,
											and crocodiles. At birth the young will be well-developed and able to move
											about at once (Precocial), or they are blind, hairless, and essentially
											helpless (altricial) (Humans). Hares and many large grazing mammals have
											Precocial offspring. Rabbits, carnivores, and most rodents bear altricial
											young. Horses have almost a full year of gestation for this reason. Mares
											like to move their young fairly quickly after birth since the blood and
											afterbirth tend to attract predators. They also like to have their young at

											stallion needs to have his sheath cleaned. The sheath is the hole or
											skin<img align="right" border="3" height="240" src="images/excalibur.jpg"
												width="240"> where the penis is pulled back in. You can clean this with
											just water, but Excalibur is specifically made for cleaning out your horse's
											sheath. Some people use Ivory Soap (unscented) and warm water. Using warm
											water sometimes helps a horse drop or relax so you can have more access to
											the penis. Another tip is to use an old sock, slide your hand in the sock
											(like a soft glove) or you can use a latex glove and then just rub and
											soften up the build up of dirt and other debris in the sheath. Make sure you
											rinse very well and <strong><u>do not use baby oil</u></strong> or other
											things to clean this area or you will get swelling and irritation that will
											require a vet visit. Most horses can do a cleaning at least twice a year.
											Depending on the horse may require more, but cleaning when not needed is
											better than never cleaning. Once a month is way too much, some bacteria is
											needed up there so too much cleaning is as bad as too little. Watch a video
											on Sheath Cleaning: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIqo7wnG3FM"

											And I always get asked, who does this for horses in the wild? In the wild
											there are <b>no geldings</b> and all male horses breed, I think during the
											breeding process the bean is either removed, worked out or when combined
											with the female bacteria the bean does not develop. Other factors could be
											diet, exercise, fighting, running more, and horses do not live very long in
											the wild. <strong>Regardless, it needs to be done for the health of the
												horse in our care.</strong>
										</p>


										<p align="justify">The pictures below show what a bean looks like and how to
											locate it and remove it. When the horse drops you have to roll the skin back
											from around the urethra and locate the bean, normally on the top area of the
											urethra. Remember, don't just try and get this the first time. Do lots of
											desensitizing with your horse and this area. Your horse has to be very
											comfortable with you digging around and being gentle in this area, so lots
											of touching and rubbing long before you try for the bean. This is not a fun
											job but it is required for the health of your horse. The white/yellowish
											bean is what you will want to remove. In the last, black and white picture
											shows how the urethra is in the center of rolled skin so that is where the
											bean will be hidden. If you are still unsure, most vets will do this and
											clean the sheath for a fee when they sedate the horse for teeth floating.
											NOTE: If you click on the pictures they will take you to other links that

											doing it and does it need to be corrected. Don't make something a problem

												<p><u><strong>Horse Eating While Ridden</strong></u>: I allow my horses
													to eat when I ride, some say never do this, I think those that say
													this don't understand or think like a horse. Here is an answer I
													gave to this question: Not sure if I understand the term "grass
													diving", never heard that before, but I think it is a horse that
													wants to eat while riding. I have this mentioned on my site
													somewhere; I allow my horses to eat when I ride. I think
													inexperienced riders or people that don't understand horses or
													people that are not able to control their horse's and they are told
													never let your horse eat. So this becomes a constant fight and tears
													down the relationship with the horse. Think like a horse, they are
													grazing animals; they love to eat and like to snack all day, feeding
													a horse twice a day is not good for them and not healthy and removes
													the mental stimulation from their daily life. So trying to fight
													this all the time is not good. My horses eat all the time when I
													ride, and when I say stop eating and move they move and when I stop,
													I let them snack. Since they know I am the leader, I decide when
													they eat and when they stop, the constant fight is not needed, they
													don't try to eat since they know I will let them eat when I say they
													can. Since you call it grass diving, I think your horses have
													learned the only way they get to eat is to grab or dive when you are
													not ready or not paying attention and they get to eat, so you have
													taught them to this or you have not taught them to respect you as a
													leader. This behavior (lack of respect) probably shows up in
													different areas since when a horse does this they are telling you, I
													know you don't want me to do this, and I know you can't stop me, so
													you must not be a strong leader that I have to respect. The way I do
													it, where I let them eat and tell them when to stop, I use this as a
													way to enforce my leader role and to show them I can stop them or I
													can let them eat, since I am consistent and they know I am leader,
													we don't fight over this, I allow them to be a horse and they
													respect me as the leader. It all depends on how you look at it. If
													you were a horse, how would you want to be treated.</p>

													you are hearing. If you don't understand a horse you can't listen to
													them, you can't read them and you can't play with them. Horses are
													individuals and you have to allow them to express themselves and be
													a horse and not always demanding, "Respect my space". The more a
													master controls his slave, the less effective the master becomes and
													more dull and mindless the horse becomes. A horse is not a car that
													you can park, turn off, leave the door open or closed and it will
													not move or do anything until you do something. It is a living
													thinking being only trying to survive in the world we have forced
													them into. Treat them as you would want to be treated if you were a
													horse. When your horse makes a mistake, it really did not think
													about doing it to you, it is simply being a horse. Your over
													reactions are normally based in frustration, fear, lack of
													understanding or anger. Those are our issues, don't make the horse
													pay for them. Small mistakes should get small corrections. <a

												<p><u><strong>Under the horse's tail:</strong></u> One of the most
													sensitive spots on a horse is under his tail. This is a good spot to
													check when buying a horse or when working with your own horse.
													Horse's are protective of this area for good reason. Want to see a
													horse buck, run and freak out, throw a<img align="right" border="3"
														height="304" src="images/ass.jpg" width="250"> rope under his
													tail and watch the rodeo. He will clamp down and curl up like never
													before. Just for fun, when I see someone yanking on a bit and
													curling a horse up with a tie down or draw reins, I want to say, let
													me help you get your horse to ball up and collect as you call it.
													You want <a
														href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_%28horse%29"
														target="_blank"><u>unnatural collection</u></a>, I know just the
													way to give it to you. When something gets under a horse's tail, and
													they tuck and clamp their tail, it traps the object and every step
													they take, the object rubs and irritates that sensitive under tail.
													By knowing this and touching this and <a
														href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacking_out"
														target="_blank"><u>desensitizing</u></a> this area, your horse
													will trust you more. So pick up the tail, softly rub the underside
													of the tail and get your horse used to being relaxed when something
													is under his tail. Start with your hand, arm and then use a soft
													rope, a broom handle and other things. Be careful at first, if you
													just stick your hand under there and the horse clamps, you will have
													your hand stuck and will be unable to move from the rear of your
													scared horse. If you do it right your horse will be better at taking
													a thermometer and more confident when you are at his rear.</p>

														target="_blank"><u>Cryptorchid</u></a> is when one or both of a
													colt's testicles do not drop into the scrotum. So the little rascal
													is up inside the horse still <img align="left" border="3"
														height="250" src="images/cyrptorchid.jpg" width="250">producing
													male hormones that create stallion behavior. The word means: (Crypt
													= hidden, Orchid = testes). I got a question from a reader that said
													she bought a gelding and found out later it was a stallion. After
													smiling and shaking my head a bit, I started thinking that maybe she
													was fooled because of a Cryptorchid. All breeds of horses can have
													this but it is more common in Quarter Horses, Saddlebreds, Percheron
													and ponies. Some testes that have not dropped are still fertile. If
													both do not drop then they are normally fertile, however if only
													does not drop then it is normally sterile. Why should you care about
													this? If some backyard Vet does the castration of your colt, he may
													or may not tell you about this. A castration is easy and can be done
													locally if both testes have dropped. However, in the case of a
													Cryptorchid, surgery is normally required. Since this procedure is
													more expensive, some people may be dishonest (dishonest horse
													people, tell me it is not so) and just have the dropped testes cut
													off and never mention the Cryptorchid. Something to be aware of when
													you think you have a gelding and he acts like a stallion.</p>

													you have done much riding, sooner or later you will have a headstall
													catch a fence or tree branch and rip or tear. As leather gets old
													and dry it breaks, so when it happens how do you control your horse
													or get it home. If you have not worked on trust and mutual respect,
													you may find out that horses remember. If you have worked on this
													with your horse, it will be no big deal. If you have a rope or
													halter then you can ride your horse back with that. If you don't you
													will have to improvise. You may need to use another piece of leather
													as a bit or war bridle and tie your reins to it. I have seen a
													throat latch used as a nose band or bit. The rear cinch can be used
													as a collar, saddle strings can be used to tie or secure things,
													your belt may help, if all else fails you can take your shirt or bra
													off (girls only) and use it. If you have done a good job at sacking
													out and using different things this will be a great training
													opportunity to see how good of a job you have been doing. I tie a
													sweatshirt around my guys neck and lead them around just for fun. If
													a horse knows how to lead right you can use a piece of thread to
													lead them. Try a hay string. It works great if you have prepared the

												<p><u><strong>Why do horse's Bite Knees:</strong></u> I get some
													questions on when horses play or fight, why do some horses go after
													the knees. The answer is they are smarter. Going after the knees is
													a way to bring the other horse to the<img align="right" border="3"
														height="250" src="images/horseknees.jpg" width="250"> ground and
													force them to kneel (an obvious submissive position). This prevents
													the other horse from running or fighting. The horse that makes the
													other horse kneel, wins! You will notice that a horse will try to
													defend and protect their knees by blocking the other horse's head
													with their head, they will back up or rear, their goal is NOT to go
													to their knees. I love to watch my <a
														href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang_%28horse%29"
														target="_blank"><u>Mustang</u></a> (Very herd savvy and
													experienced) teach my four year old cocky youngster (Buddy) a lesson
													in this. When he has had enough, he will quickly bite the knees and
													drop Buddy to the ground in an instant, if he really wants to make
													his point, he will then bite the back <a href="index-5.html"
														target="_blank"><u>hock area</u></a> and make Buddy lay
													completely down. This absolutely makes it clear, he is the
													undisputed leader. What makes this so neat is it is done fast,
													deliberate, without emotion and to teach and make a point. It is
													never personal, Buddy gets the message and they are friends two
													seconds later with NO hard feelings. It is the pure beauty of horses
													being horses.</p>

												<p><strong><u>Trailering Tips:</u></strong> Always pick your horse's
													feet before loading him into a trailer. Rocks and other debris in
													feet will just vibrate in hoof, get jammed into the frog from bumps
													and driving and be very uncomfortable for the trip. You should also
													pick them after the ride, since most horses have a nervous release
													as soon as they get into a trailer and then step and stand in their
													feces for the ride. Remember an hour ride in a trailer is like a
													horse walking three or more miles. That means a two-hour trailer
													trip means your horse already went six miles before you even put the
													saddle on. Be aware of this when your horse gets out of the trailer
													and is tired, it takes a lot of muscle energy to<img align="right"
														border="3" height="250" src="images/trailer2.gif" width="250">
													balance 1000 pounds in a moving vehicle. Another trailer debate is
													should you tie your horse or not tie. Tying helps keep your horse's
													head from falling on the floor, it prevents your horse from tucking
													his head too low and if you hit the brakes could cause your horse to
													fall. If your horse is tied, the rope may help prevent a horse from
													falling and will help him get up if he falls. I think tying may also
													give a horse a little more security since he is used to being tied
													to other things, this is just another place to get tied. Don't tie
													too short, a horse needs to lower his head to clear out debris from
													his nose, if he can't lower his head at all, he can't do that. A
													reason I hear a lot is don't tie in case you are in an accident,
													then your horse can't get free. The chance that my horse will fall
													is greater than me getting into a wreck, I tie my horses with I
													trailer them to help them balance. I don't put shavings in my
													trailer. It blows in the air, creates dust, gets in many horse's
													noses and eyes and shavings, keeps the urine in the trailer and
													increases the smell that my horse has to breathe during the trip.
													With no shavings the urine goes through the floor, evaporates
													quicker, and reduces the smell. Feeding in a trailer while
													traveling, does a lot of what shavings do, so I do not feed while
													traveling. I give hay before and after trips but not during. Tying
													your horse to outside of the trailer before you load may cause him
													to have a bowel movement. Another old trick is if a horse is showing
													signs of colic, try and load him to force or encourage a bowel
													movement and it make help him feel better.</p>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>I don't want my horse to get
															dirty!</u></strong> This is the lamest excuse I hear for
													poor horsemanship. This reason is used for laziness and it seems
													epidemic in the horse world. I have seen horses locked up in stalls,
													forced to wear hot blankets in the summer, seen manes cut, hair<img
														align="right" border="3" height="250" src="images/kkkhorse.jpg"
														width="200"> trimmed, legs wrapped and horse blankets that make

													and have no problem throwing the horse in a stall wet or with dried
													sweat all over it. <u>News Flash:</u> Horses like to roll and horses
													get dirty. If you want a clean pet get a fish. I really wish more
													horse owners would recognize this behavior has poor horsemanship and
													speak out for the horse. If your horse rolls, brush him. If he gets
													muddy, wash him. The people that complain about this and do these
													things are the same people that are too busy for their horse, don't
													have time, blame their horse for bad behavior and probably have a
													hard time handling horses. They will be the people that pay someone
													to care and feed their horse and to train their horse. And then they
													will sit around and talk about other people and other horses. For
													heaven's sake let your horse be a horse at least some time. Don't
													lock them up, punish them, and take away their natural behavior to
													care for their coat and to enjoy a great roll is some good old
													soothing dirt. If you think like a horse, this is such an easy

													the horse's mouth for a long time. You can help your friend by
													worming near fresh green grass and by having some good treats
													(carrots, horse cookies, apples) handy. After worming, you should
													hold your horse's head up and keep his mouth closed for a minute or
													so. Then let the horse swallow and try to clear his mouth. Once you
													see that your horse is not spitting any wormer out, give him a
													treat. If you give hay they may chew and spit it out thinking the
													hay is bad. Give a cookie or apple and once they eat a piece, give
													them a several bites to help wash the taste and any burning the
													wormer may be causing. Fresh green grass works well too. The more
													they chew and eat, the more it will clear the taste, smell and

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Horse Discipline:</u></strong> About the
													only thing I see people consistent on when working with horses is
													kicking a horse's butt and blaming the horse. A horse may need
													discipline sometime, not every day, not every ride and not every
													time you are with your horse. Every time you discipline a horse or
													lose your temper or over react, or get rough on the bit, or start
													yelling and calling your horse names, you should feel bad. We have
													all done it. I assure you a horse does not know why he is getting
													bent/flexed, kicked, and yelled at or being yanked around. <img
														align="right" border="3" height="150"
														src="images/horsediscipline.jpg" width="250"> After a horse
													submits to you for a second or two, he is then confused, scared and
													fearful and is NOT learning much, except that he has a predator
													(you) attacking him. He is not thinking, "Oh, I get it, I just got
													my ass kicked for the past 30 seconds for that thing I did a minute
													ago." Remember if you think like a horse, you would know how your
													horse is feeling and what he is probably thinking. If you think like
													a human, you will blame the horse for not knowing what you are
													thinking and blame him for not knowing what you want. If you have to
													kick, scream, yell, cuss, yank a horse in circles and punish your
													horse every time you ride or handle him, IT IS NOT WORKING. If you
													want change from your horse, you must first change. Your goal should
													be to minimize the number of times you have to discipline a horse
													and not to convince the horse that you can kick his ass. Quiet and
													soft hands make soft horses. Aggression, lack of knowledge, anger,
													meanness, and tempers make fearful, confused and nervous horses.
													What kind of horse do you have? You may think or see your horse as
													obedient and respectful, that does not mean he is not scared,
													nervous and worried when you are around. Know the difference.
													Release, timing and feel are the key. You have known that the horse
													can connect the correction with the wrong action or behavior. If
													your timing is too late the horse will not connect and the lesson
													will be useless and only confuse the horse. Timing and feel are
													things that are hard to teach. Only the horse can teach this, if you
													are willing to listen. If you are always teaching, correction,
													keeping your horse out of your space, then you will never have time
													to listen and learn from the horse.</p>

													this all the time. Just another sure way to tell if a person is a
													horseman or just someone who thinks they know horses. Something you
													can do with your hands before approaching a horse is to grab some
													green grass, rub and roll it it in your hands. This will help
													minimize the odor of the meat you eat and will put fresh grass
													stains and odor on your hands. A may see this as a familiar smell
													and less threatening. NO he will not try and eat your hands and he
													will still not want you shoving your hand in his face, let the horse
													decide to smell you, let the horse explore you, let the horse offer
													to meet you and don't be a predator, shoving, grabbing and reaching
													in on a horse. Respect the Horse's space and he will be much more

												<p align="justify">When removing bot eggs off the legs of horses be

													specks normally on the legs) need to be ingested to produce the
													worm. So removing these eggs in the grass, in the stall where
													feeding occurs or over hay helps the eggs get into the horse. This
													is bad. So when removing or scraping bot eggs off your horse, do it
													in an area where feeding is not an issue. Especially don't do while
													your horse is eating since the odds are some hay will fall and the
													horse will eat it along with some bot eggs.</p>

												<p align="justify">I have found more bad things in hay than I can
													remember. I have found sprinkler heads, rats, birds, snakes, string,
													wire, bolts, rocks, plastic and others. When hay is baled many
													things get grabbed up. By breaking up the hay before feeding, you
													can find these things and remove them. This can prevent your horse
													from accidentally eating them, which could harm them, cause colic or
													do other damage. Grass hay is pretty easy and fast but Alfalfa can
													take longer. It is more important to do this with Alfalfa since it
													can be hard and packed tight. Also horses love Alfalfa and tend to
													eat it faster and since it is packed so tight, they bite off more
													than they can chew and can choke or more easily eat something they
													do not find. So take a few seconds and break your hay up, look for
													foreign objects and help your horse eat slower, it will be good for
													both of you.</p>

												<p align="justify">This is a real treat for any horse. Horses love to
													roll in the dirt and mud on a hot summer day. It helps to keep the
													horse cool, provides a sun block, and keeps bugs and flies from
													bugging and biting your horse. When you hose off your horse you cool
													him off, rinse off salt and sweat and remove dirt, urine or feces
													making the horse feel better. This also packs the horse's hair down
													and it feels funny and odd to a horse, so they naturally want to
													roll, fluff their hair and get some good local pasture smell dirt on
													them. This is good for the horse in many ways, yet so often people
													want to prevent a horse from rolling so it will not get dirty. This
													shows a lack of understanding for the horse. Do your horse a favor,
													hose him off and turn him out for a good roll in some dirt, he will
													feel better and you will instill life in his spirit since he will
													feel like a horse. It will even make you feel better watching it.

																Neckerchief:</u></strong></h3>


												</center>


												<p></p>


												<p></p>


												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Why do cowboys wear scarves? Many
															reasons.</u></strong><u></u> It keeps you warm and keeps the
													wind off your neck in the cold. Silk helps remove sweat. In the heat
													the scarf protects against the sun on your neck, it gets wet from
													sweat and the slightest air will cool your neck. It can be wet and
													used to clean the horse's eyes or to wipe down the face to help cool
													the horse. It can be used to protect your horse's eyes in a dust or
													sand storm. It can be placed over your horse's face to help keep the
													flies out of the eyes. It can be wet and put over your face to cool
													and help with flies. It can be an emergency blind fold to get a
													horse past fire, cliff, high traffic area or when your horse gets
													spooked. It can be used to clean a wound or to help stop bleeding.
													When the mosquitoes are bad it keeps them off your neck and face
													area and can double as a mosquito net for your head. The scarf has
													countless uses and should not be overlooked for its superb
													usefulness.</p>


												<p align="justify">In this video I talk about uses for a wild rag and I
													show how to use a wild rag as a temp fly mask on your horse.<a
														href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oS8Nvuws8A"
														target="_blank"><strong>How to make a fly mask from a wild
															rag.</strong></a></p>


												<p align="justify">The wild rag is probably the most versatile piece of
													cowboy attire. It can function as a face mask from sun, wind, dust
													and rain. Other uses include a belt, sling, signaling for help, a
													smoke mask (wet first), dressing for a burn or injury, a hobble, a
													washcloth, napkin, bandage, folded to carry things (hobo bag), a
													strainer for dirty water, sweatband, pot holder, emergency
													tourniquet, a cover for drink, food or water, a flag, wrap around
													your hand for a temp glove, sweat rag for neck or face, a bath
													cloth, a sleeping cap for head, ear or mosquito protection, keeps
													sand and dust out of eyes, nose and ears, keeps cold wind off your
													neck or from blowing down your shirt, a hat tie down (improvised
													stampede string), keeps flies off your neck area and many other
													uses.</p>


												<p align="justify">Most good Wild Rags are made from 100% pure silk.
													Silk is a natural fiber that is soft, light weight, breathable,
													comfortable, insulates well and keeps you warm in the cold and cool
													in the heat. Silk is very absorbent (most absorbent of all other
													natural fibers) and wicks sweat and heat away from the body and
													cools the air as it blows through the damp silk. Silk is also
													considered to be hypoallergenic, not likely to cause allergic
													reactions. It is very soft and flowing fabric, which has a natural
													sheen and gets softer with use. It is said that silk is actually
													warmer than wool and it has been used by man for several thousand
													years.</p>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Care and Cleaning Your Silk Wild

												<p align="justify">Soft or mild soap, shampoo is best since it rinses
													clean and easy. Rinse well and if you have plain white vinegar, you
													can add a little to the rinse water so it balances the PH and helps
													keep your silk soft. Silk dries very fast so no need to wring or
													twist since it is not good for the fabric, so squeeze out excess
													water and hang on a tree, limb, line, trailer, truck, horse or your
													neck and it will dry quickly.</p>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Do horses need Ear
															plugs?</u></strong><u></u></p>


												<p align="justify">Need is a relative term. As a horseman, I look at
													things that help the horse or make it better for the horse. I don't
													look at things that make it easier for me. People trying to make it
													easier or faster for them create most horse problems. They take
													shortcuts and rely on gimmicks or tricks to control their horse
													instead of good fundamentals and understanding of the horse.</p>


												<p align="justify">So I question if I should promote or say anything
													positive about ear plugs since many will see it as a shortcut and
													end up setting the horse up to fail. Ears plugs should not be used
													as a substitute for training, sacking out or control. They should
													only be used to help a horse not get ear damage. So with that said,
													on the fourth of July or New Years, if you are in a high bang or
													firecracker area ear plugs may help a horse.</p>


												<p align="justify">When trailer loading and while traveling, horses have
													to deal with loud road noise, blowing debris, dust, rocks, hay and
													other stuff flying around that could get into a horse's ears. Road
													noise and big truck, sirens, horn honking, shaking and rattles in
													the trailer all get very loud when traveling at highway speeds. The
													use of ear plugs can help reduce noise and keep debris out of the
													horse's ears.</p>


												<p align="justify">Other uses are if your horse is in a parade with loud
													bands, they could help there. If you are at or near a gun range it
													could be a temporary help. If your horse is injured or needs
													clipping for vet care (NOT for being pretty) then ear plugs could
													come in handy. And don't forget that teaching your horse to accept
													ear plugs is training, it is sacking out, it is showing the horse
													you can do new things, it is teaching the horse to be submissive to
													your actions and requests and improving your position as leader.</p>


												<p align="justify">Of course if you wait to use the earplugs just when
													you need them it sets the horse up to fail. You can slowly expose
													the horse to ear plugs. Work with him routinely so he gets used to
													them and they will not be odd or strange. This way when you need
													them, the horse will expect them, know them and will not resist
													them.</p>

												<p align="justify">I get lots of questions about blind horses not
													knowing the fence line, not knowing where the water is and how do
													you keep a horse off the fence. This is a cheap fix, although it may
													not work all the time. Getting some of this stake tape or marking
													tape, which is available at most hardware stores, you can easily
													help your horses. Other advantages is if you have young or new
													horses to pasture, these horses will be more aware of these moving
													flapping tape ties and will help them learn fence lines and danger
													areas.</p>


												<p align="justify">By tying this tape along fences or in danger areas,
													you allow the horse an extra opportunity to see a fence or danger
													area since the tape flaps in the wind, looks out of place, is moving
													and horses see moving things better than non-moving things.</p>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Using Bleach - The best Cleaning around
															for Horses</u></strong><u></u></p>


												<p align="justify">I can't say this enough, using bleach to clean things
													about horses, horse grooming tools and other areas really helps the
													horse. Bleach is mainly salt, so although it has excellent germ
													fighting capabilities it also will not hurt the horse. In fact, to
													purify water that may be unsanitary for humans to drink, you can put
													a small amount of bleach in the water before drinking it. I have put
													a recommended ratio for mixing bleach and water below. The
													<strong>Best way I have found</strong> to keep water buckets clean
													is <strong>Straight Bleach.</strong> Put straight bleach in a spray
													bottle, drain the water bucket, spray bleach all over the inside of
													the bucket, let sit for about 2 to 3 minutes, rinse and fill. I
													rinse lightly so when I fill the water bucket a little white foam or
													suds may appear, the sun will burn that off and it will not hurt the
													horse. In fact the horses seem to love to get a drink right after I
													clean the bucket with bleach, not sure if it is since it is so clean
													or the mild salty/bleach taste that they like, but they do seem to
													like it. Another benefit is when you rinse the bucket out the bleach
													that is rinsed out goes to the mud and area around the water bucket
													and helps control germs and bacteria in that area as well. Bleach is
													also good to spray in your horse's hooves to help prevent thrush and
													kill bacteria (Not straight bleach in the hoof 1/4 to 1/3 bleach
													mix). This mixture is good for cleaning the inside of your trailer
													and trailer floor as well.

												<p align="justify"><img border="3" src="images/pinkgirl.png"></p>


												<p align="justify">In the picture above you will see how color sells,
													but just because it says horse gear, horsemanship, horse good or
													horse safe, it does not mean it is true. This is called marketing
													and since 90% of all horses are owned by women, pink is what I call
													a marketing impulse color. If it looks pretty, appeals to the buyer
													(women) then it sells. What people need to do is develop what I call
													a <strong>"critical eye".</strong> I talk about this a lot in my
													videos. A critical eye is questioning what you see and hear and then
													try to critically evaluate what is really going on. So when you see
													products in <strong>PINK</strong>, be aware that the person that
													designed that item is probably not a horseman and is not an expert
													in horses or horsemanship, therefore you should realize they are
													trying to appeal to those that do not have a "critical eye" and will
													buy their product on impulse or emotion. So many people think I do
													not like pink, this is not the case, and my dislike for pink is
													because of what it does to the horse. Too many people pick products
													that are poorly and cheaply made, set the horse up to fail, cause
													problems, cause pain or trick the person into thinking it is good
													and nice since the color is good or nice. As we all know, this is
													not the case. Most pink horse items are designed to sell to women
													who don't buy a product for its purpose, it is bought for its color
													- Period. They are not designed to help the horse or help the
													person, even if that is what they claim. So " <strong>Buyer
														Beware</strong> when you see pink think <strong>Critical Eye or
														Critical Evaluation.</strong> Don't forget to notice the pink
													leg wraps on the horse in the picture. "Oh Rick, those are so
													cute...... whatever...... I like horses to look like horses."</p>

												<p align="justify">As much as is needed, ground work identifies problems
													and holes in training, it teaches you how to talk and communicate
													with your horse. It allows you to see what the horse knows and
													understands and where and how the horse gets confused. It shows you
													what you are doing wrong, since it does not work. Groundwork is time
													with the horse, time moving it, controlling its movement, showing
													leadership, seeing how the horse handles and reacts to pressure,
													shows the horse that you know what you are doing and that the horse
													has to listen to you. It all comes back to time with the horse so
													you both understand each other better. If a horse tests you a lot
													and is resistant then the horse is telling you it does not
													understand or trust you or does not see you as a leader, groundwork
													is a way to clear that up and for you and your horse to learn each
													other's language. It should build confidence in both of you, it
													should not be a mandatory routine that becomes annoying or
													unpleasant for either of you.</p>

														Food</strong></p>


												<p align="justify">I have done videos on how to properly store your
													horse grain, cookies, feed, vitamins and other things that a horse
													could possibly get into, eat and make them sick. Some use trash
													cans, some use Tupperware, some just leave it in the bag it comes
													in. Any of these and many other options <strong>DO NOT</strong>
													protect the horse. No matter how much you try and think you hide or
													secure your horse food, a horse will eventually get and find it.
													That is why it is imperative that when a horse finds it, it is
													secured with a good secure, screw top or twist top system. Horses
													are much more likely not to open this type of lid. Beside the extra
													security and protection this type of lid provides, it also is
													watertight and keeps air and bugs out of your expensive grain. The
													twist tops seal well, come on and off easy and if the bucket gets
													cracked or gets a hole in it, you can take the lid and just put it
													on another bucket. So it keeps your food dry, bug free, secure and
													fresh, this is one of those things that if you take the time it
													takes it will pay off later. I have put a link below on where you
													can order these if you can't find them. I get no money for this so
													if you find it cheaper or elsewhere, great, this is about protecting
													your food so you protect your horse, not promoting a product.</p>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Clean Drinking Water for
															Horses</u></strong></p>


												<p align="justify">This is a far too often overlooked area in horse
													care. <strong>Horses need clean water,</strong> it is the only thing
													they drink. They do not get energy drinks, no Iced tea, no Gatorade,
													just water. That makes it so much more important that they have
													clean fresh water. That means work for humans. I get so tired of
													hearing all the lazy and BS excuses about horses having filters,
													horses drink dirty water in the wild, horses drink from ponds that
													are not cleaned... bla bla bla... That is all <i>first class signs
														of a lazy owner.</i> <u>Change your horse's water regularly,</u>
													NOT monthly, if you won't take a drink from your horse's water
													bucket then it is too dirty.</p>


												<p align="justify"><strong><u>DO NOT PUT FISH IN WATER
															TROUGHS.</u></strong><u></u> This another dumb rumor or
													legend that gets passed on and is absolutely wrong. You will hear
													that fish keep the water clean, fish eat the mosquitoes, and fish
													eat algae... Fish urinate and crap in the water. Fish gives lazy
													owners another reason not to clean the water since it is too much
													trouble to catch them or if it is too clean the fish may die and
													fish don't like the water to clean. Come on people, your horse's
													water is not a fish pond, it is the only source of fluid and
													hydration for a horse. It needs to be cleaned and dumped so fresh
													water is always available.</p>


												<p align="justify">The last thing any horse owner needs is more work or
													more reasons to not to do something. Fish is a great lazy and stupid
													way to justify that they clean the water so your lazy ass does not
													have too. Keep your fish in a pond not in your horse's water.
													<u>Clean your horse's water.</u>
												</p>


												<p align="justify">The best and easiest way I have found to clean the
													water bucket is Bleach. This is a great cleaner, it is mainly salt,
													it is used to purify water for humans to drink so it won't hurt the
													horses if used right. Spraying down your water bucket with bleach,
													just put straight bleach in a spray bottle, and letting it set for 2
													minutes and then rinsing and filling back with water will keep your
													water cleaner longer. Shade and NOT direct sunlight will also keep
													your water cooler and cleaner for longer. I discuss this on this
													page under <a href="index-2.html#113"
														target="_blank"><strong><u>Washing Water
																Buckets</u></strong><u></u></a> .</p>


												<p>This is another area where I talk about bleach and mix ratio and
													using bleach. So click the below link.</p>


												<p><a href="index-2.html#191" target="_blank"><strong><u>Using Bleach to
																Clean</u></strong></a></p>


												<p align="justify">Do what needs to be done and do the right thing for
													your horse, clean their water source every few days or more if
													needed. Don't make excuses to be lazy and make your horse pay.</p>

													gets loose don't panic, don't try and help and don't chase or go for
													the lead rope like a<img align="right" border="3"
														src="images/hey.jpg"> predator. Act like you wanted to let the
													horse go and calmly go over and pet the horse (Not on his head).
													Slowly work to the lead rope and catch him. If in a round pen or
													arena, don't stand by the fence or gate if some other horse gets
													loose and starts running wildly. Stand in the middle so you have
													room to move. The horse will usually run the fence line looking for
													a gate or way out. If you are in the path, you may get run down or
													stepped on. A horse always runs faster when being chased or if
													people are yelling and acting like the world if ended. Once a horse
													gets free, never chase it down and beat it or "show it who's boss".
													It will not <img align="left" border="3" height="250"
														src="images/car.jpg" width="250">understand and will only learn
													that when he gets free, he better not let this mean predatory catch
													me. If you blow it and let the horse get away, then you need to eat
													that lesson. Catch him, do something simple that he will be
													successful at and then move on. Once you teach a horse to fear you
													catching him, get ready for a long walk home if you ever fall on a
													trail. You can tell the experience of a horse person on how they
													react to a loose horse. If they calmly walk to a gate or path or if
													they run yell, get excited and panic or start to chase the horse,
													then you know they do not understand a horse or have much horse
													experience. You cannot stop a 1000-pound horse. I see people want to
													run and help, start blocking doorways or start moving to the horse
													like they are going to save this disaster, this normally does not
													help and only makes it worse. RELAX! Many horses get loose everyday,
													it is not the end of the world and if you come running to save the
													world, you only make it worse and end up getting someone else hurt.
													The best way to help a loose horse is to STAY OUT OF IT, and let the
													owner or one person catch the horse.</p>

												<p align="justify">The picture below may look cool, but it can be
													painful to the horse. A saddle and pad is designed to distribute
													pressure across a large surface area of the horse. That way your
													weight can be more easily supported by the horse's back. When
													sitting on a chair, like in this picture, you put all your weight on
													four specific small points, that increases pressure and you weigh
													tremendously. It throws off balance so when you lean back and forth,
													your already heavy weight that was being supported by four points,
													is now being supported by two points, depending on if you are
													leaning forward or back or to the side. Much like when you jump a
													horse, you take all the horse's weight that is normally carried on
													four hooves and then the horse lands on only two hooves, then you
													add height, weight, speed and you cause tremendous pain and pressure
													to the horse for a simple jump.</p>

													1 cup of water<br>


													1/4 cup of brown sugar<br>


													<br>


													<strong>HOW TO MAKE:</strong><br>


													1. Cut the plastic bottle in half.<br>


													2. Mix brown sugar with hot water. Let cool. When cold, pour in the
													bottom half of the bottle.<br>


													3. Add the yeast. No need to mix. It creates carbon dioxide, which
													attracts mosquitoes.<br>


													4. Place the funnel part, upside down, into the other half of the
													bottle, taping them together if desired.<br>


													5. Wrap the bottle with something black, leaving the top uncovered,
													and place it outside in an area away from your normal gathering
													area. (Mosquitoes are also drawn to the color black.)<br>

												<p align="justify"><strong><u>Tips for Evacuating Horses from Wildfires
															or Natural Disasters:</u></strong></p>


												<p align="justify">I forgot where I got this list from or who sent it to
													me, but I have modified the list and changed a few things, so part
													of this list is already out there somewhere.<br>


													<br>


													1. TEACH YOUR HORSE TO LOAD (and tie)! And I mean immediately step
													into a trailer. This is always important for many reasons but
													especially in an emergency when things are hectic, hurried and
													emotional. You should practice loading fast and in a hurry once and
													a while to simulate emergency conditions. That way you will see how
													your horse handles it and what needs work.<br>


													<br>


													2. Take at least one bale of hay and a BUCKET, you never know where
													your horse is going to end up. You should always have food and
													water, if a bale of hay is not available, a bag of alfalfa pellets
													or cubes or other types of bag feed.<br>


													<br>


													3. No matter what, if you take your horses or not, MAKE SURE you
													take your proof of ownership/BRAND INSPECTIONS! This will help you
													prove the horses are yours later on! (Photos work in non brand
													inspection areas!) NO Halters with names, halters get caught and
													ripped off or trap a horse.<br>


													<br>


													4. If you CANNOT TAKE your horse, TURN THEM LOOSE! They have great
													survival instincts, it's better than dying in a locked barn. This
													should not be your first choice.<br>


													<br>


													5. IF YOU TURN THEM LOOSE, write your phone number on them in some
													way! Spray paint/shoe polish, whatever you can find. Another idea is
													to write info in permanent ink on leg wraps or shipping boots or
													hoof boots and putting them on before setting them free, with
													contact information inside. Snap current pictures before release so
													you can use that for poster later.<br>


													<br>


													6. If you turn them loose TAKE THEIR HALTERS OFF! Imagine all the
													debris your horse is going to encounter! You don't want them caught
													on! IMPORTANT!!<br>


													<br>


													7. If you turn them loose, LOCK THEM OUT OF THEIR
													BARN/PEN/STALL/YARD. They WILL go back! Horses seek comfort when
													scared or nervous, so they will have a draw back to the area they
													are comfortable with. If you secure gate OPEN, if they go back they
													can leave, but if you can secure to prevent access that might be
													better.<br>


													<br>


													8. If you take your horse to an evacuation center, it is still a
													good idea to have your horse marked in some way. Sometimes
													evacuation centers have to evacuate!<br>


													<br>


													9. If you take your horse in a trailer, PLEASE tie them if you
													safely can! I cannot count how many times we were evacuating and
													found a loose horse we needed to load with ours, if the horses are
													loose in the trailer that is a disaster waiting to happen. Good
													point and if loose they can push or panic out of trailer if you
													drive through fire or smoke.<br>


													<br>


													10. If your horse is in a large pasture area, cut the fence in
													corners and leave gates open! When horses can't find their way in
													smoke/debris they will follow fence lines.<br>


													<br>


													11. I ride with reflectors on my horses hooves at night, putting
													think like this on the horses hooves will help them be seen and can
													help identify your horse later.<br>


													<br>


													12. Marking can be done by tying ribbons in the horses mane and tail
													or using a sharpie on the bridge of nose, legs, belly or forehead
													where hair is shortest.

												<p>- Insulated water troughs<br>


													- Heaters for water troughs<br>


													- Building a box around trough putting insulation, hay or horse poop
													between box and water trough<br>


													- Let water freeze, cut hole in ice of water and then only fill
													water 2 inches below hole, ice will insulate<br>


													- Bury water trough underground so it will be insulated<br>


													- Pack soil or dirt around trough to simulation buried for
													insulation<br>


													- Pack snow around trough to insulate<br>


													- Cover trough with lid and only have a small opening<br>


													- Put floater in water so horse has to push float down to allow
													water over float</p><a id="205" name="205"></a>

													<strong><u>A video of Buddy meeting a Baby Horse Kept Alone
															(sad):</u></strong>


												</center><br>


												<br>


												Out on a ride and this baby colt came running over to say hi to Buddy.
												Keeping a rope halter on a horse in pasture unattended is not safe for a
												horse and can be dangerous. Here is a picture of what can happen: <a
													href="images2/halter&#32;danger.jpg" target="_blank"><strong><u>This
															is why you don't leave halters on in pasture.</u></strong>
													<u></u></a><br>


												<br>


												This colt came over and pushed on buddy too fast which caused buddy to
												push back. There was a give and take and it was some play and some
												dominance and some submissiveness. The cold is lonely and needs herd
												interaction to learn. Keeping baby horses alone or "Imprinting" horses
												thinking humans can teach a horse better than a horse is BIG problem in
												the horse world and significantly contributing to all the unwanted
												horses and the thousands of horse shelters that are full.<br>


												<br>


												Not many listen to what they don't want to hear and then they all want
												help and run around asking for fixes to problems that they create. All
												good horsemen say don't get a young horse unless you are experienced
												with horses. Yet every, yes mainly women, wants a young horse to raise
												and take care of so they can grow and learn together. When an scared and
												uneducated horse owner gets a young horse, the only one that learns is
												THE HORSE. It learns you don't know, it learns you are scared, it learns
												to push and intimidate people. It learns that you can't control or stop
												it.<br>


												<br>


												Same with Imprinting crap. Oh I want a baby so I can imprint and teach
												it to like humans - BULLSHIT - the only thing imprinting does, since it
												is mostly done wrong - is teach a horse that they are stronger, smarter
												and can push humans. WHY you ask is imprinting normally done wrong?
												BECAUSE IT IS ONLY DONE BY PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND HORSES BUT CLAIM
												TO LOVE HORSES.<br>


												<br>


												People won't listen but I will say anyway -<br>


												<br>


												DON'T get a young horse<br>


												DON'T imprint baby horses, let horses teach them<br>


												DON'T keep horses ALONE<br>


												DON'T leave horses in pasture with halters on<br>


												DON'T believe that horses give a shit if you love them - they only care
												what you do.<br>

																Removing Mold From A Saddle </p></strong></u></center>






												<p align="justify">


													Since saddles are normally kept in dark tack rooms or trailer tack
													rooms, and most have no light and normally little to no insulation
													or air flow. Combine that with moist sweat from the horse on the
													saddle, chinches and other tack and you get a perfect condition for
													mold. Then if you add rain or humidity it is even better for mold to
													form and grow. Mold will not grow on saddles or leather that is dry
													rot and dead, nothing available for the mold spores to live on. So
													the good thing is, if you have mold your saddle is dry rotted.


													<br><br>


													Once mold takes hold in the leather, it spreads and is harder to get
													rid of. Mold is a type of fungus that consists of small organisms
													found almost everywhere. ... Outdoors, molds play an important role
													in nature, breaking down dead leaves, plants, and trees. Molds
													thrive on moisture and reproduce by means of tiny, lightweight
													spores that travel through the air. Once mold gets on a saddle or
													other tack in a tack room, it will become airborne and spread to
													other things in the area. <br><br>


													TMI: A mold or mould is a fungus that grows in the form of
													multicellular filaments called hyphae. In contrast, fungi that can
													adopt a single-celled growth habit are called yeasts. <br><br>


													There are lots of ways to remove mold. Some say use just soap and
													water, others use water and rubbing alcohol, some use Vinegar &
													water (50/50) and some use Bleach & Water. Saddle makers I know
													suggest using Bathroom Scrubbing Bubbles. <br><br>


													When cleaning your saddle try working in a warm, dry and well-lit
													area. I like to clean with saddle soap first and then any other
													treatment and follow up again with saddle soap and ALWAYS finish
													with some good leather oil to prevent drying and cracking. <br><br>


													The good thing about scrubbing bubbles is it bubbles up and gets
													into cracks and crevices that you may not be able to get to with a
													brush or your hand. The bubbles tend to act as a penetrating
													compound and since it has bleach and mold & mildew removers, it does
													a good job. <br><br>


													So, whatever method you use, remember to always finish with a good
													leather conditioner or oil after cleaning. <br><br>






													A couple of good tips for keeping your tack room better for leather
													and keeping moisture out, you can install a cheap air vent fan, like
													the one in bathrooms, that can be turned on to remove air and
													circulate air. Some people also put a dehumidifier in their tack
													room, then you can see how much water is removed from the air when
													you dump water out.
