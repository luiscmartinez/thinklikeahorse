		<h1>Videos of Horses Being Abused, Neglected and Killed<br>
			All these Horses Suffer Because of What People Did</h1>
	</center>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ8W51hDh0A" target="_blank">Man Beats Downed Horse in Street</a> :
			This jerk beats a horse in the middle of the street while no one helps this poor horse. The horse looks weak
			and skinny and either slipped or too tired to get up and almost does not get up until another brave man
			helps with the beating. The meanness of people never seems to know an end.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSGnjcMNdMA" target="_blank">Man Kills Horse with Axe Handle</a> :
			This guy kills this poor trapped scared horse and cuts his throat while other brave men stand around and
			laugh and find enjoyment out of this horrible event.
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">Notice the horse's faces, the fear, the confusion, they are only doing what they
			are made to do, they are scared and trapped and now very hurt and they will be raced the next day with lots
			of pain killers given to hide the limps and pain. Notice the announcer stating the Ambulance is on it's way,
			the people doing this had a choice, the horses were forced and had no choice.</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEep5BrexT0" target="_blank">A Poor Donkey is strapped to boat</a> :
			This poor little Donkey is just standing there being a good boy and has no idea what is about to happen. I
			can't image the fear and helplessness he feels when this boat takes off. How can people not see the harm and
			fear they cause.
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">Notice the track is wet and slippery, notice the rider pulling tight on reins,
			notice the horse tries to get his head, notice the guy pulls and restricts the horse's head, that is why the
			horse fell. Jumping a horse is dangerous in the perfect conditions, it is bad for the horse and dangerous
			for the rider. But you can win a nice ribbon or tack, so it's OK...</li>

	<h4>I am sure seeing these is not a pleasant task. Over my years I have seen too many similar things first hand and
		watching this on a video is different than seeing it right in front of you. I hope people understand why I try
		and expose these things so more people can see horse abuse for what it is. Awareness is the key to change.</h4>
