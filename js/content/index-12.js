      Hobbles are a great tool for all horsemen. Some think hobbles are mean or
      cruel and if used the wrong way, I would agree. Hobbles are an advanced
      "sack out" technique that will give your horse confidence, enforce
      your<img

      leadership position, teach pressure and release and build trust. It
      teaches horses to give to pressure and learn to deal with being trapped.
      It desensitizes a horse's legs to being confined, trapped or stuck. A
      hobble-trained horse is less likely to tear his leg off if he ever is
      caught up in wire or a fence.

    <p align="justify">
      Hobbles have a long history in horse training. In the past they were used

      and to

      dominate a horse. I do not use them for that and do not recommend them for
      that use. In the days of horseback, when most all transportation was by
      horse, there were not tie post or tie points everywhere. By placing
      hobbles on a horse, you were able to secure your horse in open areas with
      no trees or tie points. That way in morning, your horse would have grazed
      all night, but would not have traveled miles away from you and your camp
      site. A horse can still defend himself if hobbled and can still kick and
      run. If you are out riding and do not have a lead rope or place to tie a
      horse up and you need to relieve yourself, you can hobble your horse, take
      care of business while your horse snacks and relaxes. See a video on
      Hobble Training:

      your horse will teach him patience, will teach him to give to pressure,
      will teach him not to panic if his legs are trapped and it comes in handy
      if you have no place to tie. It is important in the training process to
      teach the horse to give to pressure without panic. I do this with a soft
      cotton rope and work on each foot and the body. By putting the rope on one
      foot and putting pressure on until the horse lifts his foot and then
      release. Soon you will be able to lead the horse with a rope on any foot.
      After the feet are done I put a rope on the girth of the horse and teach
      him to lead from that pressure. Each time I teach a horse to give to
      pressure, he will learn to give to pressure in other ways. Prior learning
      makes later learning easier. After making sure you desensitize all the
      feet good, you can put the hobble on. Make sure you are in a soft area
      that is enclosed and safe. Also, make sure you have a lead rope and halter
      on your horse. The time you put hobbles on a horse they normally get off
      balance and will fall to their knees, you have to be ready to keep the
      head up and prevent it from hitting the ground. Another common action is
      the horse may jump or rear forward and up, you need to be ready to react,
      take control and calm the horse, so you can help him through his fear.
      Once the horse struggles a bit, the will stop and stand still looking to
      you for help, if you have sacked them out correctly. As soon as they stand
      still, you being very calm, take the hobbles off, reassure the horse and
      then have it slowly walk off a few steps. This tells him he is not trapped
      and can move now. All training time as many side benefits. It teaches you
      to better understand your horse, it causes you to spend time with your
      horse and it allows your horse to learn you, your behavior and your cues.
      All build trust and a better relationship.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      After the first hobble and removal, then put the hobbles back on and just
      stand with the horse with the lead rope ready to support the head if he
      falls. He may just try to lift each leg and test the hobbles; if he does,
      praise him and let him know it is OK. By talking or distracting the horse,
      he will forget about his fear and being trapped and it helps him learn to
      deal with his fear of the unknown. If he calms down and stops testing,
      about 20 seconds, then take them off and let him stand, he will not move
      since he thinks he is still hobbled. Then ask him to take a step or two
      and relax. Then put them on again, this time he should test and struggle
      less, now you can try and walk to his butt and get him to move his back
      legs. If he does this just a little, stop and praise him, let him stand
      for a few seconds and take the hobbles off. Let him stand after you take
      them off and then ask him to take a few steps and show him he can move.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      All of this tells him, that he will not be trapped forever, it is no big
      deal to have hobbles on and you will take them off. After you establish a
      routine for him, then he will be less stressed.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Then maybe put them on one more time and have him move his butt both ways
      at least a quarter turn and no more than a half turn. Then let him stand
      while still hobbled for about a minute or two and then take them off. That
      will be a good start.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      After a few times of doing this in a nice soft area with sand or soft
      footing, then you can take him out to nice green grass and hobble him and
      let him eat and graze. Here he will learn how to move and eat and to not
      worry about his feet being trapped. Keep him on a lead rope for the first
      few hobbles to help him balance and having you holding the lead rope and
      near the horse, it will give him confidence and routine. Most horses only
      fall to their knee once and then they stop, as long as you stay calm and
      help them up and "Don't make a big deal" out of it. If you act like you
      expected it and deal with from a position of calm, then the horse finds
      calm in your actions and behavior. Remember a horse is only a reflection
      of the person handling him. If the person is calm, confident and in
      control, then the horse will be the same way.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The first few hobbles should not be over a minute or two, the more you put
      them on and take them off, the more the horse will accept them and will
      not panic. After you have a good foundation, then you can start putting
      them on longer and in different areas.

      I had a lady who called herself a "Dressage owner" who wrote me for advice
      on handling her horse.

      />She got mad at me for telling her she was the problem with her horse
      acting out. She was upset, so she blamed me and then said had she known I
      used hobbles she would have never asked me a question. (Too bad we cant
      send horse owners off to trainers instead of their horse.) I just shake my
      head at people so narrow minded and then think about their "Poor Horse"
      for having to deal with them. Hobbles are about teaching your horse to
      release to pressure, to trust you even when you take away his ability to
      move and not to panic when trapped. This is good for any horse in any
      discipline. Just because I ride western and hobbles are mainly used by
      western riders, does not mean that all horses and all horse owners cannot
      grow and gain from using and learning about them. Horsemanship is about
      the Horse, not the person, the style of riding or what discipline you
      practice. You teach a horse that you are a leader by moving them or by
      restricting their movement. When you control their feet and mind you show
      your leadership ability. That is what makes good and calm horses.

      are a standard type of leather (figure 8)hobbles. Cost can be from $20 to

      These hobbles are made of raw hide that is braided, much like a raw hide

      generally lined with fleece so they won't cut into the mare's legs and
      they are used only until she accepts the foal she is expected to nurse or
      until she stops being aggressive to her foal. They have enough give to
      allow her to walk around the stall.

      When there are no suitable objects to which a horse can be tied, it may be
      possible to use hobbles. This might be useful on trail rides or when
      stopping in an open park or pasture. The horse must first be trained to
      accept the hobbles. This is best done when the horse is first being
      trained, by an<img

      experienced horse person in a round pen or confined area, with soft ground
      or sand. The first time hobbles are put on a horse they will probably
      stumble and may fall, so make sure you have a lead rope and halter on so
      you can support the head if the horse falls. Some horses can travel a fair
      distance when only the front legs are hobbled to each other. Once your
      horse learns to run and move with hobbles, you may have to use sideline
      hobbles or tie a lead rope to the front hobbles to slow the horse down.
      Most horses if they trust you and look to you for safety and security will
      not want to leave you and will try to follow you a bit. So some small
      movement is not all that bad.

      right. Lots of sacking out and desensitizing the feet, legs and teaching
      the horse to give to pressure and not panic when their legs are trapped or
      restricted. Lots of release and keeping the horse calm. The horse should
      be gaining trust in you, not fearing you.

      <strong><u>Camel Hobble</u></strong
      >: This style of hobbling is used on camels to prevent them from running
      off. Some do this to horses. You have to be careful and not leave it on
      too long or it could do damage. I would only do this for an emergency to
      take down a horse for emergency vet care or to save a horse from hurting
      himself. Again you must be careful not to hyper extend the knee joint,
      hurt the horse or put the horse into fight mode from his instinctual fear.
