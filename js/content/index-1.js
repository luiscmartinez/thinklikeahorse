The boy named the horse <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucephalus" target="_blank"><u>Bucephalus</u></a></strong> because his head was broad, like that of a bull. The horse would not allow anyone to ride him except young Alexander. The two grew up together and developed a deep bond of love and respect between them.

<p>Why do many people place a horseshoe over their door to ward off evil? One legend states that in England in the tenth century, there lived a blacksmith named <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstan" target="_blank"><u>Dunstan</u></a></strong>. One day the Devil came to Dunstan's forge to have his cloven hooves shod. Dunstan agreed to make the Devil's shoes, but instead he lashed the Devil to the anvil and furiously beat him with his hammer. The Devil begged for mercy. Dunstan made the Devil promise never to visit a door where a horseshoe hung.<strong>The Devil</strong> quickly agreed and since then, blacksmiths and others have placed a horseshoe over their doors. The horseshoe must be placed with the toe down so that it can catch goodness from heaven. And what ever happened to the noble Dunstan? He became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstan" target="_blank"><u>Archbishop of Canterbury (961 - 980 AD)</u></a> and was later made a saint after his death.</p>

<p><strong>In 1066</strong>, William the Conqueror of Normandy put approximately 3,000 horses on 700 small sailing ships and headed across the channel to England. William had come to secure his right to the English throne from King Harold. Transporting William's horses across the English Channel created a logistical nightmare - one that would be faced to some degree by all future mounted armies in the field. William assembled his men and horses on the <strong>French coast</strong> approximately one month prior to the invasion. Extensive research has been done into the logistics of supporting the equine element of a force of this size for this period of time. His calculations assumed that the majority of the Norman's warhorses stood approximately 15 hands and weighed between,300 and 1,500 pounds; each would have thus required around 25 pounds a day in hay and grain. Based on these assumptions, he concluded that the horses would have needed:</p>

The feudal system of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ages" target="_blank"><u>the Middle Ages</u></a> placed the farmer on his land under the control of a lord, but the lord, in turn, had the means of supplying the farmer with horses to use in the manor's fields.

<p>To protect the horses in transit, slings were constructed to allow the horses to swing with the roll of the ship, and to take the weight off their feet. Confinement in damp, dark holds and lack of exercise took its toll on equine emigrants. Sometimes half of the horses died en route to America. That section of the <strong>Atlantic Ocean known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_latitudes" target="_blank"><u>"Horse Latitudes"</u></a></strong> gained its name from the sad fact that innumerable dead horses were thrown overboard into the ocean during these early voyages of colonization.

<p><strong>In the 1600s</strong>, an Italian horse trainer and his horse performed in front of God-fearing peasants in France. <u>These people burned and killed the trainer and his horse.</u> To them, natural horsemanship had to be connected to the devil. Man was convinced that a horse had to be controlled by muscle, force, fear and violence. So anyone not using these methods must be connected to evil. Being the ultimate predator that man is, it is always easiest to resort to his primal aggressive traits.</p>

<p align="justify">Many towns and cities in America have streets called <strong>"Race Street".</strong> Such streets gained their names from the habit of running horse races on them. In 1674, the citizens of Plymouth, Massachusetts evidently grew tired or frightened of the races in their villages, and created an ordinance forbidding racing.</p>

<p align="justify">Early American roads were merely Indian paths, only passable on foot or horseback. Horses were scarce in colonial America, so an ingenious system of sharing a horse was devised based on <strong>"ride and tie."</strong> One man started out on the horse while the other began walking. After a set distance, the rider would dismount and tie the horse to a secure object. When the other man had walked to the tied horse, he mounted and rode past the original rider to the next tying point. In this fashion, each man got to ride part way and the horse even got some rest!</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_horse" target="_blank"><u><strong>The Quarter Horse</strong></u></a> is one of the original American breeds of horses. The precise origins of the Quarter Horse have been argued incessantly and vigorously from its very beginning. The oldest ancestor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_horse" target="_blank">the <u>Quarter Horse</u></a> is the Hobby, which was imported in numbers to the mid-south in the 1600s and 1700s. The most decisive influence on the Quarter Horse came from the Thoroughbred sire, Janus, imported as a 10-year-old to America <strong>in 1756</strong>. Janus stood at stud for 24 years, but the origin of the mares he was bred with is the subject of dispute.

Many horses would refuse to swim the stream, regardless, the rider was sure to get wet. The alternative was to search out a farmer with a ferry. Ferries were often no more than a deck and rails attached to two dugout canoes. Two parallel boards with cleats across them served as a gangplank for bringing the horse aboard. A gangplank was kept on each shore. Most horses would board easily, but now and then, a nervous horse would have to be blindfolded. The horse was kept in the middle of the board by cross-tying him to the boat's side rails. The average fee for ferrying a horse and rider was about 12 cents.</p>

<p>The term <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecoach" target="_blank"><u>"stagecoach"</u></a></strong> is derived from the fact that these vehicles traveled in segments, or "stages" of 15-20 miles in length.<br>

At a stage stop, horses would be changed and travelers could refresh themselves or sleep for the night at the taverns which served the coaches. Weather, wrecks, and road hooligans made the stage trip a memorable adventure. Some say the name "Dashboard" which is still used in today's cars, originated on the stagecoach. The flat board where the feet sit and where the brake pedal was, was commonly used to slow or stop runaway horses. The driver would lean back in the seat, pushing his feet against this board while pulling back on the reins when the horses "dashed off". Hence the name "Dash Board".

    <strong>Horsemanship in the 1800s</strong> was still an unscientific practice, perhaps due, in part, to the mysticism of the past. The following bizarre suggestion is taken from a collection "How to Handle a Savage, Vicious Horse" "Approach the horse firmly, fixing your gaze upon his eye. Have in your hand a six-chambered revolver, loaded with blank cartridges. The moment he attempts to savage you, fire, not point blank at him, but directly in front of his face. This will give the horse a sudden shock and take his attention. If he is in a stall this is your opportunity. Before he has time to recover himself, rush in and seize him by the headstall, and again discharge the revolver close alongside his face, saying: 'What do you mean?' 'How dare you!' (presumably in a stern voice!) <strong>In a few hundred years will people look back at our gag bits and spurs and think if we learned anything from the past?</strong>

    The machine was a platform that the horse was loaded and secured and then a steam engine would spin it. This would make the horse dizzy and presumably calm. Unfortunately, the machine failed to work since it was set up in theaters. At the time the stages were commonly angled down toward the audience. Due to the un-leveled surface the machine did not work. Good thing for horses, or maybe today people would still be spinning horses to train them. <u>Could this be where our famous "Merry-go-rounds" came from.</u>

    Even so, the company directors saw the potential of the steam engine, and decided not to use the horse as a source of power. Despite this, during the age of steam, the demand for horsepower actually increased. They transported goods to rail heads and delivered local freight from the trains. <strong>Of course, later someone decided to name a Bit after the Tom Thumb for it's stopping power. Pain devices are still continued today and many still believe that horses need pain metal bits to control a horse.</strong>

    <p align="justify"><strong>In 1912 in Stockholm</strong>, the horse once again became a part of Olympic competition through the vigorous efforts of Count Clarence von Rosen. The Olympic classes include individual dressage, team 3-day event, and individual and team jumping classes, with each nation entering a team of six riders. Equestrian events are the only Olympic competition in which men and women compete on an equal basis. Once again, the horse is the great equalizer.</p>

        </center>The war used horses in great numbers for non-cavalry purposes. It is estimated that some six million horses served and substantial numbers of these were killed.<strong>By 1914</strong>, the British had only 20,000 horses and the United States was called upon to supply the allied forces with remounts. In the four years of the war, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_states" target="_blank"><u>the United States</u></a> exported nearly a million horses to Europe. This seriously depleted the number of horses in America.


        <p></p>


        <p align="justify">When the American Expeditionary Force entered the war, it took with it an additional 182,000 horses. Of these, 60,000 were killed and only a scant 200 were returned to the United States. In WWI over 1.5 million horses were used and over 1/3 of them died. In spite of the innovations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ww1" target="_blank"><u>World War I</u></a>, <strong>one reality remained the same; the horse was the innocent victim.</strong></p>

    <p align="justify">In just 50 years, America's horse population dropped by almost 20 million. <strong>Over 10 million horses died in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_2" target="_blank"><u>World War II</u></a> fighting our battles.</strong> Now the horse was no longer a necessity. Over the years, horses have become a recreational pastime. A century ago, people had horses in order to live, now people live to have horses. Man, as the ultimate predator, would have long made the horse extinct, had it not found a use for it. Early men could only travel as fast as they could run. By mounting a horse, man was suddenly one of the fastest predators on earth. Man could now carry heavy loads, hunt more efficiently and travel the lands like never before.</p>

If the script called for a horse to be shot, they actually killed and shot a horse, if it called for a horse to be run off a cliff, a horse was actually run off a cliff to his death.

    </center>With this new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship" target="_blank"><u>Natural Horsemanship</u></a> taking hold, there is now a new horse language emerging. We do not break horses, we start them. We don't work a horse, we play with them. Discomfort has replaced what pain once did. We encourage a horse to find the right answer instead of forcing the answer with pain or fear. We always reward a try and never expect perfection on the first try. We are partners not masters. We communicate through the principles of horse psychology and understanding. By understanding how the horse thinks, <strong>we can change our behavior in order to get the desired behavior from the horse</strong>. Natural horsemanship not only makes better horses, but it is making better people. Horses cannot understand the concept of punishment and a horseman knows this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_horsemanship" target="_blank"><u>Natural Horsemanship</u></a> is about gentle persuasion. Today's true Horsemen take pride in their horsemanship and develop a light soft touch through understanding, feel and compassion.

    </center>A savvy horseman, who had learned the horse, would put on demonstrations. In these demonstrations, he would lean over to his horse, act as if he was whispering in the horse's ear and then his horse would follow his command. These men became known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_whisperer" target="_blank"><u>Horse Whisperers</u></a>". This is a man who listens to and understands the horse. These men deploy a kind and sympathetic view for the horse's needs. Horse Whisperers are people who communicate with the horse, without force, fear, or pain and adapt their training methods to help the horse find the right answer.<br>

    <p align="justify">The final legacy of the horse is an increasing equine population of pure and distinct breeds; horses of quality and beauty, horses for sport, work, and pleasure. Today there are hundreds of breeds and types of horses. According to the <strong>American Horse Council, in 2001</strong> there were approximately 6.1 million horses and 7.1 million people involved in the horse industry in the U.S.<br>


    <br>


    The same survey indicated that the horse industry directly produces goods and services of $25.3 billion and has a total impact of over $112 billion on the U.S. gross domestic product. The industry's contribution to the U.S. GDP is greater than the motion picture, railroad and furniture and fixtures manufacturing industries. It is only slightly smaller than the apparel and other textile products manufacturing industry. The industry pays a total of $1.9 billion in taxes to federal, state and local governments. Like when our country began and as it continues today, the horse continues to carry America.<br>
