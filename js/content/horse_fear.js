        I am going to try and address the many ways that horse fear appears and
        how it affects the horse and your relationship with your horse. This is
        such a huge and all encompassing topic, but I will try to cover it
        briefly. The links I put on this page are ones that I think would be
        helpful if you read them and improved you understanding of this critical
        topic. This page is long and it may take some time, but if you learn one
        thing you will have grown in your Horsemanship and that is good for the
        Horse.

      You cannot love if you fear what you love. People do not get nervous
      around chocolate cake. Understanding horse fear and human fear are very
      different. Humans do NOT fear their horse will eat them; however, a horse
      does fear they will be killed and eaten. In reality, a horse's fear is
      much more valid than human fear. However, as humans we cannot help think
      we are the center of the universe and we are always more important than
      all other animals.

        <strong>Question:</strong> What are the only two things Horses are
        scared of?<br />
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Horses fear two things things that move and
        things that do not move.<br />
        It is their nature of being a horse remember this the next time you get
        upset with your horse for spooking.

        ></strong
      ><i></i> We must not forget that fear is not always negative. Fear forces
      us to be more aware, alert and to examine things more closely which
      enables us to make better decisions and live longer. That is as long as we
      can reason and understand things so we can make intelligent decisions.
      However, we have to be aware that the human mind is a powerful thing. If
      we imagine something is happening, the mind will not know the difference.
      If you focus on fear too much then you will be focused on other more
      important things like staying alive or controlling what you do. Fear is a
      waste of energy and puts you worrying about the future rather than the now
      or present. Love, compassion, and courage is the opposite of fear.
      <strong>Fear affects and prevents love.</strong> Fear not only from you
      but from others also trains your horse. So letting other people handle or
      be around your horse trains your horse. Therefore, if others show fear,
      move away, jump and act spooky around your horse, then your horse learns
      from them and is taught bad lessons. Your horse can learn to be afraid of
      fear and he may associate fear with people and that sets the horse up to
      fail over and over again.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      A good answer to fear is knowledge and understanding.
      <u>Balancing fear with reason is a good start.</u> It does not matter if
      it is a fear of spiders, heights, darkness, or horses. All fear causes
      more issues than just the fear. Notice in the picture above that
      directions to love and fear are in opposite directions. Far too often, I
      see struggling horse owners who are scared of their horse and then try to
      love their horse. Not only do they fail but their horse fails as well.

        <strong><u>Fight or Flight Response to Fear</u></strong> <u></u>
      </h3>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <p align="justify">
      This is a fascinating topic to me. Both in the military and in police work
      the knowledge of this response system is critical to survival.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Superman, super human, unbelievable strength and other words are often
      used to describe this response. Briefly, when we, as humans, perceive a
      severe or extreme threat, this fight or flight response kicks into action
      automatically. We can't stop it and we can't prevent these automatic
      responses from happening.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Things that go into action when faced with extreme fear is the heart rate
      jumps to over 200 BPM, this to pump large amounts of oxygen rich blood to
      our major muscles, anticipating our need to fight or run (flight). Our
      vision narrows so we can focus on the threat, our hearing shuts down to
      prevent loud or distracting sounds, blood is blocked off from
      non-essential body parts and functions like fingers and toes, the
      digestive system stops working since it is not essential to surviving,
      endorphins and chemicals are dumped into the body to help in different
      areas such as strength, power, speed, vision, hearing, reflexes and
      reactions. Sometime the bladder or intestines void (dump) all in an
      involuntary instant (Hence the old saying: He got the poop scared out of
      him). All of this is designed to increase your chances to survive.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Although this system is very effective and efficient, it has its draw
      backs. Slowing down, moving back to normal speed, getting rid of all the
      hormones, chemicals and adrenalin that is now in the system and not being
      used.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      When this response kicks in it prevents some of the other body functions.
      You lose dexterity, lose hearing, lose vision and lose difficult and
      complex thinking ability, blood is redirected to large muscle groups and
      everything is re-directed to fight or flight functions used to help you
      survive.
    </p>
    <div class="indented">
      <p align="justify">
        <strong><u>Side Note:</u></strong>
        <tt
          >Often after cops are in a shooting, a high risk incident which
          triggers the Fight or Flight, they will lock onto the threat and will
          not hear other cops and cannot see anything but the bad guy or threat,
          since their hearing has shut down (auditory exclusion) and their eyes
          lock on the threat (loss of peripheral vision), they may appear to be
          locking in a trance. So cops are actually trained to approach cops,
          who were just in a shooting, from the rear and place their hands on
          the officers so not to startle the officer and to let him know others
          are present, since they may not have the ability to hear or see
          them.</tt
        >
        Being aware of these automatic responses should make you more aware and
        perhaps enable you to notice what you do when you get scared and if you
        focus on this you can change, modify or control your actions.

      The best bad example I see is the stupid and unreasonable thing called
      <u><strong>"The Emergency Dismount".</strong></u> Kids and adults are
      being taught that when in trouble or scared on a horse, you should do an
      Emergency Dismount (jump off and abandon the horse). The idiot that
      thought this up <strong>was not</strong> a horseman and did not have a
      clue about understanding horses and the way they learn and think. This
      <i>suicide procedure</i> is a sure fire way to teach a horse to run off,
      scare you and learn how to get you off their back. This brainless dismount
      is not any different than jumping off a horse that lies down or getting
      off a horse that starts pawing, or jumping off a horse that rears,
      <strong><u>listen carefully,</u></strong
      ><u></u> if you get off a horse when a horse does something, you teach a
      horse when it repeats that behavior, you will get off of him. This is such
      a basic concept if you understand that release teaches horses. Release of
      pressure tells a horse, whatever it was doing when it received the release
      that was the right answer to get release.
      <tt
        >Hence, if you only get off your horse when he stops and stands still,
        the horse learns to stop and stand still when you get off him. If you
        get on your horse and allow him to walk off he learns to walk off when
        you get on him.</tt

    <p align="justify">
      When people don't understand horses and listen to what is being taught and
      repeated in the horse world, "Show the horse who is boss" carp, they can
      triggered a horses genetic survival instinct and they wonder why the horse
      reacted, reared, ran off, got scared or if trapped and cannot run why it
      attacked and went into fight mode. How can humans expect to turn fear into
      confidence if they only know how to push, be tough and always pushing a
      horse? Being tough, hard, and rough is preached but not many explain the
      other parts to understanding and communicating with horses. It is also our
      nature as humans, Predators, that when we get scared of fearful, we get
      aggressive or attack. Any idiot can lock a horse up, put a chain on it's
      nose, beat it and show it who is boss. It takes a horseman to use feel,
      timing and respect in order to gain a willing and reliable horse that is
      treated fair and given a good horse life.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      As stupid humans we may feel anxious or fearful but we have the ability to
      evaluate, look at things from different positions, we have greater
      reasoning ability and can deal with our fear without going in to an
      involuntary instinctual response mode. A horse only knows how to be a
      horse, his instinctual responses is what keeps him alive, it is genetic
      and implanted deep within the horse, it is not wrong and it is not mean,
      it is pure survival. Understand that, accept that and your horse will know
      that know.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Understanding the flight or fight concept and your body's response to fear
      will help you do better in many ways. Not only will it help you to better
      understand what you are going through, it will also help you understand
      what your horse goes through when it is scared. Similar things take place
      in a horse when they are pushed into <i></i>flight or fight or when their
      automatic response system is triggered. I have put a link below to good
      page that explains this
      <strong>Fight or Flight response system</strong> in more detail and shows
      how complex this system is and yet how fast and efficient it goes into
      action and how well it works.

      I worked as a Lifeguard many years ago while stationed in Korea. The pool
      I worked at had many Koreans and Americans, so there was a language
      barrier on my end since I did not speak Korean. During my time there, I
      made several rescues. After a few, I learned that giving directions and
      trying to communicate did not do much good. Much like talking English to a
      horse, it really does not matter what you say, the horse does not speak
      English. Another thing that became very clear is when someone is fighting
      for their life and thinks they are about to die, they do not care what you
      have to say. Once their flight and fight response kicks in - they care
      about one thing, <i>Not drowning.</i> So I could talk until I was blue in
      the face, or until they were blue in the face (No pun :), and they did not
      care, they wanted something or someone to grab onto and save them. Their
      focus was clear - <strong>staying alive and Survival.</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In Lifeguard training they have many examples of Lifeguards that were
      killed or drowned during rescues. This is very common, when a drowning
      victim thinks they are going to die, they fight and grab and will drag,
      choke or knock out their rescuer. Not intentional, not being mean, not
      being stupid, they are just trying to stay alive and if they hurt or kill
      you in that effort, it is not intentional or personal. The same is true
      with horses. When they want to live or think they may die, they will do
      things that may hurt or kill you. This is why it is a good idea not to get
      yourself or your horse into that situation.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      As a Lifeguard I would defuse the victim's ability to control the
      situation by doing an approved technique called an underwater approach,
      going underwater, grabbing the victims legs from underwater, pulling the
      victim underwater, with them facing away from me, so I could grab them
      from behind, gain control of them and prevent them from hurting, grabbing
      or drowning me, all of this so I could save them. Now some may say that
      what I did was mean, or how cruel to pull a drowning victim underwater
      when they are fighting for the life or that I was not very fair and
      probably scared the crap out of them. I say, who cares. If I have to scare
      you to save you, then I will scare you for your own good so I can save
      you. Again, this should sound a lot like what I say about horses.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The same is true with horses. People want to love them and help them, but
      they do not want to scare them or be mean to them or do something that
      will help them, for fear of not being nice, caring, or loving.
      <i><strong>I say Horse Pucky.</strong></i> Get over it, you must be
      willing to do things for the good of the horse. It may appear mean or
      unfair, but if it makes the horse safer and gives the horse a better life
      and keeps you safe so you can provide care and a home for the horse,
      <i
        ><strong
          >then DO IT and stop whining about how hard it is or how you don't
          want to be mean.</strong
        ></i
      ><strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The things that are important here are horses and people will not listen,
      can't listen or do not want to listen when scared or fighting for their
      life. Communication suffers when fear is involved. Your communication with
      your horse suffers when you are scared. When you focus on yourself and
      your fear, and your safety and your wants, you abandon your horse. That is
      NOT fair to the horse and it sets you both up to fail.

        An interesting little study was done years ago. It dealt with
        eyes/pupils dilating when looking at thing that make you happy or
        excited. In this study, they found that men and women eyes dilated
        differently.

          >Save the hate mail, if you want to see this as sexist send them the
          mail, I am just passing this on to make a point.</tt
        >. In this study they found that the eyes of males dilated when they
        looked at pictures of naked women (maybe women in bikinis but not sure).
        However, the eyes of women dilated when they looked at pictures of
        babies. Therefore, this is just another study that proves men and women
        are different, they think differently and see things differently. So why
        do eyes dilate, it is to allow more light in so the picture can clear,
        it is the body's way of helping to survive and see threats better. Eyes
        dilate when the heart rate increases since that could be a sign of fear
        or flight. So when looking at things that make you excited or happy,
        your heart rate increases and your eyes dilate. Can you control this?
        No, it is an automatic system that occurs without your control.

      Another example of panic and fear where communication shuts down is with
      bees and wasp. Every see a child or an adult stumble into a wasp nest and
      get attacked or swarmed, they panic, the run, they scream, will trip,
      fall, roll, run into things and they go into fight or flight mode and
      since they can't fight the wasp, so they run (flight). Trying to talk or
      give direction to someone in this situation will NOT work. In fact, if you
      get in the way, you are likely to get run over, knocked down or knocked
      out. And then people would be calling you a stupid human or a spooky human
      or a human with bad breeding, or
      <strong>some other dumb label that would make no sense.</strong> When in
      fact a person doing this is just doing what is normal and is trying to
      survive. How can people not see the similarities between this situation
      and a horse that is pushed too fast or forced into his flight or fight
      response? Better yet, next time you see a person in this situation, try
      putting a chain in the human's mouth and start yanking and pulling on it
      and see how that works out. The next time someone shoe catches on fire try
      and tell them they are being bad and need to listen. How can no one see
      that using PAIN (bits or spurs) in these situations cannot make things
      better?

      These survival instincts may change in the future as more horses are being
      bred in captivity and domesticated. During the domestication of the horse,
      man has decided breeding. This took out the survival needs factor and
      replaced it with the looks and image factor. This means it is no longer
      "the survival of the fittest," but now the survival of the breed, color or
      looks that suit the human's best. In addition, the trend of locking up
      horses and keeping them alone is changing horses. People are taking away
      the ability of horses to learn from other horses. Herd behavior is being
      loss and not being passed on and in the end the horses will pay.

      <i>answer to a question about fear.</i> Read my take below before you
      visit the link and read her answer.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Ohhhhh Rick, Julie Goodnight, she is so good she can ride bridleless in
      reining. Save it people, she may be able to ride backwards while eating
      dinner, I am not talking about her riding, I am talking about her answer.
      Read her answer to fear, after she pumps her books and videos that will
      fix all the problems, she then goes into making the person feel good and
      tells all kinds of things that won't help her horse but it sure sounds
      good. Things like talk to a pastor, get counseling, maybe the mean husband
      is pressuring her, maybe she should take some lessons, maybe she should
      not ride Thoroughbreds since they are volatile and emotional
      <strong>(Are you kidding me)</strong>, she just labeled an entire breed
      and gave every person with a TB a reason and excuse to mistrust and fear
      their horse. This is the crap that just irritates me. Of course her answer
      ends with information on how to get personal lessons from her - for a
      price ($$$). Really? This is what women want, a bunch of feel good talk
      that gives you lots of options on spending money???? And people call me
      sexist when I call it like I see it and give a voice to the horse, but let
      another woman just "talk" nice, blame other things, tell you to go pray
      with your pastor for your horse issues and label an entire breed and
      suddenly she is so nice and helpful. This answer does not help the horse;
      it helps the person feel good and helps Julie's bank account.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I would really like one person, who gets this advice as a usable answer
      that helps them to let me know how this advice specifically helped you
      with your fear? Give me the secret I am missing. Don't tell me you got
      lessons or ordered her book, or just feel better after reading this, that
      is all temporary crap for you, explain what this answer said that helped
      you <i><strong>get a result</strong></i
      ><strong></strong> from your horse?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I am not trying to pick on Julie, I am pointing out that fear can be
      justified, blamed or dealt with in different ways. I happen to think
      dealing with it head on and realizing that the fear is YOUR problem and
      not the horse's. If you do not get or accept that, then all the other crap
      is just crap.

      The insecurity associated with a fear or fear of abandonment can ruin your
      relationships with your horse. Too many people (mostly women) want their
      horse to love them so much that they fear being mean, correcting or giving
      the horse discipline and direction. Little do they know they are sending a
      clear message to the horse that they <strong>are not</strong> strong
      leaders and that they should not be trusted or depended on. Since the
      horse will not follow a weak leader, these people ruin the relationship by
      trying to save it. This creates an unhealthy relationship for both the
      horse and the person who is scared and will only get more scared. And I
      mean scared of either the horse or scared to hurt the relationship with
      the horse. Fear is not productive and will lead to a path of danger,
      injury and failure.

      <i><strong>Is Rider Fear Transferable to Horses?</strong></i>
    </center>
    <i><strong></strong></i><strong></strong>
    <p></p>
    <p align="justify">
      The insecurity associated with a fear of abandonment (your horse will not
      love you) can ruin relationships with your horse. Too many want their
      horse to love them so much, they fear being mean, stern or correcting and
      giving the horse discipline and or direction. Little do these people know
      they are sending a clear message to the horse that they are not strong
      leaders and that they should not be trusted or depended on in a crisis?
      Since the horse will not follow a weak leader these people ruin the
      relationship by trying to save and protect it. A horse does not have a
      choice about wanting a strong leader, it is in their DNA and is
      instinctual.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      If you can make fear your friend you can deal with it more effectively. If
      you understand that fear is useful and helps you if you control it and use
      it. There is no doubt that Horses feel your fear. They do NOT smell it -
      they feel, see fear and hear it in your voice?&nbsp;When a rider gets
      scared, they tense up, their heart rate goes up, their response system
      kicks in, they pull or squeeze the reins, they clutch or grip tightly with
      their legs and often lean forward, all conflicting cues and all confuse or
      put the horse on guard and makes the horse uneasy.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Learning is about understanding &amp; knowledge and not just changing your
      behavior. Learning creates the potential to perform certain behaviors
      better because of experience or understanding. Recognizing your fear and
      the responses to fear will help you be aware and control those reactions
      and will help you gain confidence in yourself and your horse will gain
      confidence in you.

      What a horse needs to hear and see from it's leader is the same thing we
      want from our horse. They want and need calm, focused and good direction.
      They need to know what to expect from us and to know we are consistent and
      fair. Horses find comfort and confidence in routine or in knowing what is
      going to happen before it happens. They need to develop habits and we help
      them get this by being consistent and always ready to help. We destroy
      this when we are scared, not focused, worried, unsure, guessing or trying
      and failing. The latter teaches the horse to see in us what we try and
      hide.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Being comfortable around horses is very important. Horses are always
      watching and learning so seeing you being comfortable and feeling safe
      sends a good message. If they see you as fearful, jumpy and always pushing
      them out of your space, they learn that you cannot be trusted and then
      they cannot be comfortable or feel safe around you. Remember: A horse is a
      reflection of you; they give back what they get.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I think fear causes people to be too aggressive sometime. Like the saying,
      make the wrong thing hard and right thing easy. Some may confuse making
      something hard is the same as punishment. This is a bad mistake.
      Punishment of a horse does not work and normally only destroys the
      relationship and makes the horse do behavior that is more dangerous. When
      thinking of making the wrong answer hard, think is more open terms helping
      the horse find all the wrong or undesirable answers, so you can help the
      horse find the more correct or right answer. By keeping pressure, making
      the horse uncomfortable you make the horse try things to find release of
      pressure. As the horse is looking for release, if you are doing it right,
      he will find the right answer and if your timing is right, you will
      release pressure so the horse understands what the right answer is. Too
      many just chase the crap out of horse and think that is showing the horse
      who is boss and that is making the wrong answers hard. That is only one
      part, the other part is helping and leading and showing the horse the
      right answer so you can release pressure and the horse can learn what the
      right answer is to get the pressure released or stopped.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Most people cannot do this in a round pen or on a lung line. If you are
      competent on the ground then you can transfer that competence when you are
      in the saddle. Everything in horsemanship is interconnected. You may think
      you can compartmentalize things but the horse knows. That is why trainers
      and gimmicks do not work. People wanting you to buy their videos of
      special equipment want you to think you can get success with a special
      soft rope. The soft rope is just one part of the equation. Knowing how to
      be soft, knowing how the rope moves, feel, timing, rhythm, release, not
      being too fast with the rope, not hurting the horse with the rope, not
      accidentally hitting the horse in the eye or ear with the rope, all of
      this is what makes the special soft rope work. Since all of this takes
      time, experience, failure, good horses teaching over the years and
      understanding of the horse, the special rope is just another rope. Of
      course if I tell you this I can't get you chasing success by paying 69
      bucks for a 12 dollar rope. The slow way is the fast way with horses.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Your inability to be comfortable around horses sends off powerful negative
      and non-trusting emotions and I think horses know this and can feel this,
      much like people can tell if they are being stared at. If you get scared
      of a bee and panic, swat and run, the horse can't reason why you did it,
      it just sees what you are doing. It shows weakness, it shows lack of
      confidence, and it shows fear. If you step in a mud puddle and get mud on
      your pretty pink shoes and you get upset, mad, and angry or focus on your
      so called problem, all the negative energy, actions, reactions and
      behavior will send powerful messages to your horse. The more this is done
      the clearer the message becomes to the horse.

      A University of Guelph researcher has found horses can sense when a rider
      is nervous and as a result will become nervous themselves.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Prof. Uta von Borstel, Department of Animal and Poultry Science, hooked up
      53 pairs of riders and horses with heart monitors last summer at the
      International Student Riding Nations' Cup in Innisfil, Ont., and measured
      their heart rates during stressful situations.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      About 25 per cent of all fatal sports injuries are related to horseback
      riding, and about a quarter of all horse related injuries are due to the
      horse being scared, said von Borstel, who's been riding horses since she
      was a child.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      "Horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports you can do," she
      said. "Studies show that your chances of getting injured riding a horse
      are far higher than while riding a motorcycle because the horse's nerves
      can make it jump unpredictably. If we can do something to control horses
      and their reaction to fear, then we can reduce the number of accidents."
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      She conducted her research as a PhD student with Prof. Ian Duncan and Anna
      Kate Shoveller in the Department of Animal and Poultry Science, Prof.
      Suzanne Millman in the Department of Population Medicine and Prof. Linda
      Keeling of the Swedish Agricultural University.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The heart rates of the riders and horses were used as an indicator of the
      level of fear they were experiencing during two fear inducing tests.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      For the first test, von Borstel told the riders she would be unexpectedly
      squirting the horses with a water gun to startle them. She said this
      caused the riders to become nervous because they didn't know when the
      horse was going to be squirted or how the horse would react.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Although the horses were never actually squirted with water, von Borstel
      found the heart rates of both the riders and the horses were higher than
      when they were measured in a comfortable situation.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The horses had no reason to be nervous, yet they were still nervous. They
      were sensing from the rider that something wasn't right." Does a nervous
      rider mean a nervous horse?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Whatever the horses were sensing, it was very subtle, she said.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      There were no visible signs of the riders feeling nervous or tense. It may
      have been a slight tightening of the reins or their legs squeezing the
      horse a little harder. We aren't sure exactly what it was, but it was
      obvious the horses were quite tuned into the riders and how they were
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      For the second test, von Borstel had the riders and the horses approach an
      umbrella that was opening and closing, spurring fear in both.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      During this test, both heart rates were mildly higher than they were in a
      comfortable setting, but the horses' heart rate was just as high as it was
      during the first test when only the riders were feeling nervous.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Although the umbrella was a strong stimulus for fear, von Borstel said
      both the riders and horses knew it was there. As a result, the riders were
      probably able to better control the situation and the horses' level of
      fear.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Most of the people who took part in the testing were experienced riders,
      and she found the more experience they had, the better they were able to
      control the horses' fear, particularly in the second test.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      "Perhaps a more confident rider, who notices the horse is nervous, is able
      to control his or her own tension or nervousness."
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      She said this is promising for the purposes of her research because it
      means a rider can influence the level of fear a horse experiences.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      "Riders could develop some relaxation techniques that would help them
      relax when they are feeling nervous. That might help break up the nervous
      cycle that occurs between rider and horse and help reduce the number of
      injuries and even deaths from horse related accidents."

      My issue with the below information about horse fear is it only addresses
      the horse, it does not address the person or the human factor such as
      experience, training, confidence and other factors of the "Stupid Human".
      Again, there is a belief that horses have problems; this is wrong, horse
      problems are caused by people. Still worth the read with lots of good
      information.

      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" target="_blank"
        ><strong><u>Vietnam War</u></strong> <u></u></a
      >, for you youngsters that was another useless and foolish war US
      politicians got us into, the so called enemy in this war was the Vietcong.
      It was reported that the Vietcong, who ate mainly rice and fish and were
      not big meat eaters, could actually smell the Americans at great
      distances. This has been reported because of the Americans diet of meat.
      Could it have been from the cigarette smoke or the lack of taking a bath?
      Who knows for sure, but we know dogs and horses can smell things up to a
      mile away. Can we humans do this as well? In addition, if we can, what
      kind of signals and messages do we send out, that we do not know or are
      unaware that we are sending? Since 80% of communication is non verbal,
      what are we really saying to our horse without knowing it?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Do we stupid humans have what is called "Spidey sense?" That feeling when
      we know something is wrong and the hairs on back of neck stand up telling
      us something is wrong, but we can't be for sure. Is their other
      subconscious cues that warn us and change our actions and behavior and we
      don't know why?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Are people really aware of the messages they send? And if so, do they
      realize how the horse perceives the messages they send?
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I know some women who are scared to death of spiders or mice and react
      loudly and with panic when they are near one. Then they react this way
      when a bee or wasp flies by them, then they act this way if an aggressive
      rooster comes by them, then they act scared if other horses come by them,
      then they act scared if the tractor drives by since they think it scares
      their horse, then they act scared if someone else uses or cracks a whip,
      then they get scared if another rider runs their horse by them, then they
      get scared if their horse gets scared and they get scared trying to
      control their horse during all this. Fear creating fear and the horse is
      watching.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Then these same people start trying to control everyone and everything to
      try and prevent their fear or prevent their horse's fear and when they
      fail, they get frustrated and mad. Then they loose patience with their
      horse, call their horse names like stupid, and blame the horse for not
      listening. Then when their horse runs off, they will get a bigger bit
      since they get scared when their horse runs off and they feel out of
      control, so they think by getting a bigger more painful bit they will be
      safer. Then they wear a helmet so they will feel safer. Then they start
      doing things to avoid all things that make them fearful and they
      concentrate on avoiding all their fears. When all the time they are
      teaching the horse many bad lessons. The horse is always learning. These
      people are so busy <i><strong>trying NOT to be scared,</strong></i
      ><strong></strong> to avoid their fear, to control their fear and they
      have no clue what they are teaching their horse. Moreover, they certainly
      cannot work on their horsemanship or their horse when all their efforts
      are focused on their fear.

      Taking action to overcome fear. If you are scared to fall off a horse or
      slide out of the saddle due to poor balance, you can just be scared and
      always fear it or you take action to deal with it and remove that fear.
      You can work on your balance in other ways, you can exercise to get
      stronger legs and hips, you can do other things that require balance, like
      riding a bike or motorcycle, so you will develop your balance muscles, and
      you can ride your horse more to improve your balance, seat and confidence.
      Or you can remain scared, avoid riding, and justify the fear as being
      real. The choice is yours. The bigger problem that people miss with fear
      it is all compounded with horses. Every thing is intermingled and
      connected in horsemanship. Nothing stands alone and you cannot isolate
      your fear.

    <div class="indented">
      <p align="justify">
        Lets look at this rider in the picture below. At first look, she may
        look like she has a good seat and can ride a horse at a canter upon
        closer look, notice the off balance seat. Her pointed toes (off
        balance), the leaning forward of the back (off balance), the line from
        shoulder, straight down, should be almost in line with back, hips,
        ankles and head, but it is not. Also notice the way she is holding the
        reins. Palm up hold is wrong and gives not grip or power if needed.
        Reins coming from the horse's head need to be at the bottom of the hand
        with the other end at the top of hand and thumb. She is holding the
        reins wrong. If this horse stops or turns fast or jigs, she will lose
        her balance. That will cause her to try and use the reins for balance
        and pull them sideways and leaning to one side of the horse. The horse
        will see this as fear, as possibly think the rider is trying to pull the
        horse down. The does not know when a rider falls why? The horse normally
        only see someone trying to pull him down and a horse will not go down
        easy, so he will resist as much as he can part from fear and part from
        survival. Many people say heels down, but do not know the significance
        of this. When the heels are down it forces a deep seat, it shows control
        and confidence since rider instinct is to point the toes down (fetal
        position from fear). So inexperienced riders point toes unconsciously
        and are unconsciously off balance.

      Let's talk about the fear of falling from poor balance. Every time you
      ride, this fear is present, since you are scared and you are worried, you
      cannot focus on your horse, you cannot focus on your soft hands, your
      directions, or your communication, you cannot focus on improving yourself
      or helping your horse you can only focus on your fear of falling. So now,
      many other things suffer because of this one fear. Then because of this
      fear, your horse reacts differently, suddenly he is insecure, he gets
      nervous more and you get more nervous, soon neither of you has confidence
      in the other. The one problem 'fear of falling' is now a full blown fear
      of many things that now encompasses lots of fear, confusion and unclear
      messages. Fear is crippling. Moreover, no book is going to fix it, no
      trainer, no super secret special gimmicks will help. What will help is
      understanding, confidence, experience, accepting it and overcoming it with
      knowledge, education and trust. Trust in yourself and trust in your Horse

        goals, you adjust your actions used to reach your goals.

      The study about the fire hose and fear is clear that horses can feel a
      person's anxiety and fear. It may seem that the horse is only reading the
      physical reactions of a person, perhaps the tight legs, stiff hands,
      bracing by the person for a possible reaction and other subconscious
      physical reactions. However, the study on people knowing when they are
      being stared at, shows that even the human can feel things that are NOT
      physical. So surely if the human can feel this a horse can feel it better.
      So both studies really help confirm the other and only give more proof
      that you cannot hide your feelings or fear from a horse.

      You can do your own experiment on this if you just look back at your
      previous interactions with your horse. I see this with Mr. "T". If I am
      worried, preoccupied with other matters or upset at something else going
      on in my life, Mr. T always knows it. No matter how I try to hide it or
      conceal it, Mr. T acts different when I feel differently. When I am tense,
      he is tense. When I am relaxed, he is relaxed. He knows how I feel and
      mirrors those feelings. Which is why the saying: A horse is a reflection
      of you. Another saying is: Meet the horse, meet the person. If the person
      is fearful, spooky, untrusting, neurotic, attention deficit disorder
      (A.D.D), then the horse will display these traits. No matter how smart or
      good people think, they are at hiding who they really are, horses will
      know and they will see your fear and insecurity. Some will try to mask
      this by being loud, mean and aggressive or using pain or control devices
      on the horse, this only reinforces what the horse already knows. Good
      Horsemen will see this as well. Good Horsemen know that horses tell on
      their rider or handler. A horse's reactions and behavior will tell many
      things about their owner, their so called training and other things. Watch
      the horse and learn many things about the person. Meet the horse and meet
      the person.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      This is just another reason why sending a horse to trainers never works
      out. A horse knows the difference between you and the trainer. They know
      if the trainer will spur, hit, or manhandle them and they know if you will
      not do those things since you love them and want to be their friend.
      Loving a horse will NOT cover or hide your fear or insecurity. In fact, I
      think it makes it more clear for the horse not to trust you and not to
      believe who or what you are. When you try to deceive the horse, he learns
      not to trust or believe you. The more you try to fool a horse the more he
      learns to mistrust you and that you are not who you try to be and will
      never really know who you are.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I called these people "Fakers". They are phony, scared, uneducated about
      horses and think they are being so smart. Fakers think they are fooling
      the horse and fooling others. They are easy to spot if you know what to
      look for. They will be loud, they will be talking and explaining what they
      do and why, they will be trying to justify how smart they are and how much
      they know. They will always want to share their limited and mostly wrong
      knowledge by always giving and offering unwanted advice. They will justify
      things like my horse needs spurs, my horse needs a bit, my horse needs
      tough love, all of this is just a cover for their fear and inability to
      progress and learn better ways. However, the Fakers think they are fooling
      others and fooling their horse. Those who know are not fooled and the
      horse is never fooled. The horse may go along, it may not exploit their
      ignorance and it may just accept them in certain circumstances. But the
      horse will never develop a bond or trust, it will not grow with the Faker
      since the Faker is in denial, the Faker has convinced themselves that they
      are not the problem and it is the horse's fault and the horse is the one
      with all the problems.

      Licking and chewing is not necessarily learning, it is a release of
      tension, allowing saliva to produce, getting oxygen and normally showing a
      release in pressure or tension. Could it be said that when a horse relaxes
      he learns? Can it be that when a horse learns he feels comfortable
      therefore, he reduces his fear? People may be right when they say a horse
      learns when he licks his lips, but I think that is a superficial
      explanation. To fully understand horses and how they live and see things,
      I think we should look deeper and see that reducing fear is done with
      better understanding and communication
      <strong>NOT pain and more intense pressure.</strong> Fear is such a
      powerful motivator and inhibitor in horses and in people. As a Horseman,
      it is our responsibility to help the horse, understand his fear and
      discover ways to communicate with the horse that helps reduce his fears,
      pain and confusion. Which is why I say

      Evolution and time has shifted fear from its primary instinctual use to
      now it is more of an emotional use. Is this good or bad? At best, it is
      confusing and makes the water muddy. Clean and exact answers are not
      available. Much like in horses and horsemanship too many variables to come
      up with one right answer or one right way. One thing is for sure, is fear
      causes many people to create what they fear instead of what they want. In
      horses, if you project, intentionally or unintentionally, a negative or
      fearful behavior or emotions, the horse will pick this up. Conversely, if
      you are positive and trusting you will send the horse messages that will
      instill confidence and leadership. Being clear and honest with yourself
      and your horse is the best policy. Trying to trick, conceal, hide, and
      deceive your horse only makes your horse confused and more likely to
      distrust you.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Just one example of this is watching someone kicking their horse to go,
      but they are scared and worrying about the horse possibly going too fast
      so they pull on the reins out of fear. Sometime this unconscious pulling
      makes the horse go backwards, when you really want the horse to go
      forward. This subconscious fear that people do instinctively and without
      thinking about it is what causes lots of failure in horses. Then people
      wonder why the horse is backing up when they think they are telling the
      horse to go forward. This unconscious fear and actions are very confusing
      and unfair to the horse. This could be corrected easily if the person was
      more aware of what they are doing and realizing the horse is only doing
      what it did, because of what they did.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      When people develop a positive attitude towards fear they grow. Fears have
      less of a chance of establishing roots in an individual with a positive
      attitude. Some say there is absolutely no reason to fear anything. Fear is
      never warranted. It is always counterproductive. Denying fear and fooling
      yourself only promotes a negative attitude and causes failure. Don't let a
      concern turn into a fear. Concerns are fine, fears should be unacceptable.
      Don't predict the things you fear or they may come true.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      We strengthen what we focus on. The more attention we give to fear the
      stronger it gets. The key to overcoming the incapacitating affects of fear
      is to bring our emotional, logical and instinctive behavior into harmony
      and balance with our horse and ourselves. And this is NOT done by
      <strong>"making a horse respect our space".</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Controlling Fear is about not focusing on the fear. If you fear the dark,
      do not focus on the dark, think about light, if you fear a dog biting you,
      think and visualize a dog licking and loving you. In horses, people fear
      their fear, they fear the horse's size, they fear getting hurt by the
      horse's reactions to his fear, and they fear the lack of ability to
      predict what the horse will do. A person's survival instinct is to protect
      themselves and not to get hurt, so it is as natural as the horse's fear to
      survive and not want to get hurt. However, here is the big difference to
      me. A horse does not fear getting hurt, he fears being eaten and killed. A
      horse's fear is much more valid, strong and powerful than a human's fear.
      Yet people want to "demand" that a horse to ignore and control his fear at
      all times. That is an unfair expectation, it cannot happen,
      <strong>there are NO dead broke horses,</strong> no horses that do not
      have fear and believing this or expecting this from a horse only sets the
      horse up to fail and that means you fail.
    </p>
    <div class="indented">
      <p align="justify">This is one person's opinion of fear:</p>
      <p align="justify">
        "We feel fear because we are afraid something painful or unpleasant will
        happen to us.&nbsp;And the reason we expect a hurtful experience is
        because we consciously or subconsciously believe we are at fault
        inadequate, incompetent, awkward, clumsy, laughable, shameful,
        blameworthy, deserving of punishment, and the list goes on."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p align="justify">
      I am not sure I necessarily agree with the above statement, but I will
      agree that ego and pride causes people to react to their fear differently.
      One way people do this is to blame the horse. By blaming the horse, or
      breed, or the trainer or other things, it shifts responsibility from them
      to someone else. This sets up an attitude of I am right and I know
      everything therefore it must be the horse of someone else. If you think
      you know it all, you are not open to learn or listen. That means not
      learning or listening to your horse or to anyone else. This attitude is
      very widespread in the horse world. This "I know it all� attitude and it
      just hurts horses since the people with this ego end up doing stupid
      things that causes a horse to pay.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I believe fear is transferred from you to horse and from horse to you,
      knowing this and accepting this will help you control your fear, which
      will help the horse deal with his fear better. Fear goes up and down the
      reins and through the saddle, a horse knows from your heart rate, to your
      stiffness, to your voice and other subconscious clues you send out. Trying
      to hide this from the horse makes your horse distrust you. Horses know if
      you know, they know if you are trying to fool them or trick them, they
      keep you honest. This is why I believe horses do not fear kids, since kids
      are fearless and honest. Horses do not fear or react to mentally
      challenged (special needs or retarded) kids, since these kids do not try
      and hide who they are, they do not deceive or trick, these kids are honest
      since they don't know how to be dishonest, this comes off as non-fearful
      and non-threatening to the horse. This makes the horse feel comfortable
      and safe.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Or course the other side to this is older humans, who are just getting
      back into horses, are overly scared of getting hurt, they think they know
      how to hide their fears or know how to trick or deceive the horse. This
      only shows the horse that these people are not honest and they should not
      be trusted. Then the horse fears and mistrust the fearful human and you
      end up getting what you give and the horse becomes a reflection of you.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      When you try to get a horse to ignore his fear, but you show fear, you
      actually show the horse he has something to fear. The horse does not know
      you are scared of him, he knows you are scared, he knows he cannot trust
      you, he will learn that you do not trust him and you end up creating what
      you try to prevent.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Controlling your fear and emotions is critical to help a horse that is
      scared, the more you control your fear, the more it will become natural
      and you will not need to work at it or think about it, it will just
      happened. Knowing that you are responsible for making your horse confident
      or spooky will help you be more aware of what you do and what you are
      showing your horse.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      So not wanting to get hurt is normal and shared by most living things;
      however the way people handle or deal with that fear is very different.
      Some avoid the things or situations where they can get hurt. Some attack
      or seek out the things they are scared of to prove they can over come or
      to prove they are not weak or to prove they are as good as any man. Some
      handle fear with anger, talking and voicing their strong position or
      control, all in attempts to hide their fear. Some handle fear with control
      or perceived control with pain or force; if these people stay involved in
      every detail and think they can prevent every failure, they think they are
      hiding their fear. Then they think they can control their fear by control
      events. Even if everyone knows that no one can control everything and
      danger is everywhere. It is unreasonable and unattainable to prevent
      everything that may go wrong, yet I see many inexperience horse owners
      running around trying to control, prevent, and avoid fear and any hint of
      trouble. In addition, they normally create a spooky, fearful and insecure
      horse. There are many ways that fear can be attacked but regardless of how
      fear is confronted, if it is not controlled or faced it will prevent
      learning, growth and advancement in your horsemanship.

      Fear causes us to avoid things, to do things the easy way and to choose
      the path of least resistance. This is a cheat. You cheat yourself and your
      horse. The old hard ways, bits, and spurs are easy. The philosophy of, if
      it is not broke do not fix it, is the easy way. As ambassadors of the
      horse, we should always be looking for kinder and better ways to interact
      with our horse. We should not follow the path of others, we should make
      our own path and leave a trail for others to follow.

          it would mean nothing. If I do not change my voice or verbal cues then

          I talked, every time I said hi to someone they would have to guess if
          I wanted them to do something. Many of my verbal changes, reactions
          and communication have become instinctive to me, since I do them with
          little or no conscious thought. This has happened over time from doing
          it for so long and now it has become somewhat of muscle memory, habit
          or instinctive type action.</u

          Professional golfers did not get to top by trying to play golf in
          their spare time and only playing a few hours on the weekend. This is
          the same for professional Ball players or professional Musicians or
          Doctors or any other field that requires a large amount of proficiency
          and knowledge in order to be considered good or at the top of the
          field. It is no different with horsemanship. In fact, it all the other
          professions mentioned, you are not likely to get killed or serious
          injured if you make a mistake while learning or don't know what you
          are doing.

          They are fooled into believing that horses are kind and won't hurt you
          and that horses love people and horses like to be ridden and horses
          are not mean. Even if all those facts are correct, everyone wants to
          ignore the other obvious dangerous factors. Like how horses are not
          tame like a pet dog, they are instinctual animals with a high drive to
          survive. That they are a fear driven animal and their fear and fast,
          quick, and unpredictable movements is what keeps them alive.

      Those that end up getting good in their horsemanship and those that put in
      the effort and time to understand and succeed, have normally invested
      considerably. They have put in time to read and learn, they have failed
      many times, they have learned from many horses, they have learned from
      others that have failed and others that have succeed, they did not just
      get lucky or have a gift or have some special horse whisperer gene.

      I absolutely agree there are many verbal and vocal cues that go into
      horsemanship and communication with horses. However, I think horses learn
      a lot of it and it is not instinctual. A Horse has very limited and small
      number of verbal or vocal communication skills. So just because my horses
      may have developed this skill it is not by accident. This is learned
      behavior and was caused or taught by my actions and me. Most anything can
      be taught to horses with consistency. Since horses are so attuned to their
      environment, they learn very quickly. This unique and fast ability to
      learn is why most people teach their horses many things and then wonder
      why or how a horse learned what they do. When working and training dogs in
      the military you have to use a suspicious voice and tone to get a dog to
      want to find or want to look for someone and that is called a verbal cue,
      just like a command to SIT is different than a happy hello.
      <i><strong>A request is said different than an order.</strong></i
      ><strong></strong> The problem I see is that most people are inconsistent
      and find it hard to grasp the concept of controlling their body movements
      and positions and posture consistently, so trying to add more and teach
      them to control their voice, inflection, tone, volume, words (key or cue
      words), flat, monotone, pitch, all combined with speed of your language,
      emphasis, loud, angry, stern, requesting, authoritarian, praise and
      probably many I missed, is all very complicated and might just confuse
      people more. Voice, verbal and vocal language is an entirely different
      level or aspect of communication. I also think it is very small compared
      to non-verbal, especially with horses. So concentrating too much on this
      is somewhat putting the cart in front of the horse.

      I do think people are better at verbal communication than horse, about the
      only thing they may be better at than horses. But all the experts say 75
      to 80% of all communication is Non-verbal, like expression, body and hand
      position, eye contact and many other non-verbal cues people use when we
      think we are communicating verbally. Many of these are done subconsciously
      and without thought.

      When I am stressed, fed up irritated with ignorant situations, Mr. T
      totally picks up and he changes, he looks and wonders if I am talking to
      him, if I am irritated with him or asking for something or telling him
      something. He changes and I notice it and recognize it and I have to clear
      it up for him. I have to downgrade my voice, tone or volume and let him
      know it is not meant for him or I have to be more direct and make sure he
      knows it is meant for him. Constant adjustments, constant changes, always
      reflecting on the situation and the horse's responses or changes I get
      from a horse. This enables me to change what I do so I can get the desired
      response and help the horse find the right answer.

      <strong>The old saying: "The only constant in life is change"</strong>
    </center>
    <strong></strong>
    <p></p>
    <p align="justify">
      This saying also applies to horses. Every thing changes a 1000 times a
      day, the wind, the environment, the surroundings, cars, planes, rain,
      other people, other horses, new trailers, new fences, new dogs, new
      chickens, trees that are cut down or branches that have fallen off, the
      length of the days, the temperature, your mood, your fears, your focus,
      your stress level, your patience, your understanding, your confusion, lots
      and lots of changes are always taking place and a horse knows and
      recognizes most of them.
      <strong

        depends on it.</strong

    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Prey animals can tell when predators are hunting or just resting. Horses
      do not run from all predators just because they are predators. They do not
      run from all dogs or all lions or all people, they evaluate many other
      factors to determine if they are being hunted, are in danger or if the
      predator is hunting or stalking.

          >Horses pay close attention to all changes since their life and
          survival depends on it.</strong

      ><strong></strong> These traits are slowly being lost through
      domestication, but the deep instinctual genes are still present and will
      continue to drive this survival instinct and survival reactions.

    <p align="justify">
      I talk a lot about you cant separate things into compartments when working
      with horses. You can't just work on your voice and just work on your body
      and just work on rearing or just work on tying, everything in horses are
      connected. When you think you are working on just one thing, if you do not
      pay attention or have enough experience, you will end up teaching other
      bad things while trying to fix just ONE thing.
      <i
        ><strong
          >Getting too focused is just as bad as being not focused at
          all.</strong
        ></i
      ><strong></strong> Which is exactly what happens when fear gets involved
      and ends up taking over. When inexperience people get scared with their
      horse, they forget everything except their fear, they get tight, they get
      stiff, they squeeze, they bend their legs, their heart rate goes up, and
      their ability to reason is decreased and most completely forget about
      their horsemanship, their horse or what they are doing or telling the
      horse. Most people absolutely vapor lock on their fear or their survival
      and can only think about not getting hurt or making the horse listen, so
      they do not get hurt. What they do not know is by doing this instinct
      reaction to their fear, their odds of getting hurt goes up 10-fold. The
      longer people are in horses, the more times they get hurt, the more hard
      lessons they learn will teach them how to ignore their fear and
      concentrate more on the horse, what the horse is feeling and how to help
      the horse. A big problem now in the horse world is there are many older
      women who cannot afford to learn these hard horse lessons, so they either
      avoid situations so they will not have to learn or make excuses for the
      horse's behavior. That incorrect behavior only holds the horse back and
      holds them back.
      <i><strong>Fear is such a crippling emotion in horsemanship.</strong></i>

      So being aware that using your voice correctly and consistently with your
      body can assist in better communication with your horse, this may be good
      to know and good to be aware of, however, I don't think it is a big
      critical area that should be incorporated into your horse horsemanship
      until you are first proficient with good body language communication. But
      it is a good piece of knowledge to be aware of and to watch and notice if
      others use it correctly or if they are unaware that they are using it all.
