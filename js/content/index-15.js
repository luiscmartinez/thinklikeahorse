    <p>You are causing this by being to easy on
    the horse. You have to understand horses
    better to understand this.   Read
    my web site about herd behavior, you and this
    horse is a herd of two and you are either
    higher than her or lower than her. You have
    let her think you are lower by letting her
    get away with this. As she gets older, she
    will get bigger and stronger, then you will
    be in real trouble.   Stop this
    behavior NOW or you will set this horse up to
    be abused later for being mean.
      If this horse turns her butt to
    you, have a rope or something and whack her
    butt HARD, this will scare her and she will
    run off, then she will learn that she cannot
    do that and will be a better horse.
      If she pins her ears, then back
    her away and make her move away from you,
    that will tell her you are higher and she has
    to show you respect.</p>

    <p>Lots more going here than what you are
    seeing,you keep describing this horse as if
    he has the problems, he does not, it is you.
    All horses run, buck and do the same things
    that you are describing, learn ONE thing, a
    horse is a horse and that is all they know
    how to be. You say he is running off on you
    bucking, I say you going to fast and not
    giving enough direction to stop this from
    happening, "direction is better than
    correction". The horse does not want to run
    since it is not sure what will happen and its
    gets scared and nervous. BTW, your rope
    halter is tied wrong, this is "attention to
    detail", read my rope halter page on my site.
    Don’t try and get this horse to run,
    only walk in comfortable areas an ride in
    very familiar areas, just slow walks, nice
    easy stops, turns and back ups. YOU are
    teaching this horse to buck by letting it
    buck and causing it to buck since you are
    trying to go too fast. "the slow way is the
    fast way" don't rush it or the horse will get
    nervous and scared. Lots of round pen work,
    NOT just chasing the horse, send the horse
    out, trot, canter and walks then have it come
    to you and follow you, you want more time on
    following you then you pushing it and making
    it run. lunge the horse in the round pen
    with a rope and rope halter on, it the horse
    bucks, (this is when you want to try and make
    it buck) so you can take the head away and
    make it STOP bucking so the horse leans that
    you can stop him when he bucks. What you are
    showing him now by getting bucked off is that
    YOU can’t stop him, therefore you are
    not in charge, so you are not a good leader,
    so he should not trust you or listen to you.
    A horse will not listen unless and until he
    has too. Forget the love and thinking that
    this horse cares about you, it is a horse, it
    only cares if he is higher or lower than you,
    if is higher then he will push you and treat
    you like a lower herd member(not being mean
    but thinking he is protecting you), this is
    not good, many will see this as love, it is
    not, it is dangerous and sets you and the
    horse to fail. As for the horse facing you
    and side stepping when you round pen him, he
    is telling you, you cannot make me run, you
    are weak, you are not a strong leader, you
    cannot make me listen, you are not higher
    than me - I agree with the horse! And that is
    why he running off and bucking with you, the
    exact same reasons.You need to read my entire
    web site, invest the time so you understand
    horses better or you will make this horse
    worse, a better bucking, more disrespectful
    and will end up getting hurt and then the
    horse will get blamed.</p>

    <p>Well this is definitely not a horse
    problem. Being retired Air Force, I have had
    my dealings with cocky fighter pilot types,
    so that is a hard habit to break and I
    suspect that is what attracted you to him in
    the first place. If you can't convince him,
    ain't no reason for me to try. I
    would only suggest that he do his best to set
    the horse up for success. I
    normally don't promote
    wearing a horse out to train them, but with
    confirmed buckers, that need to be trained,
    there are a few extreme techniques and I
    would only do them if it means the difference
    between a horse going to slaughter or having
    a bad life if it is not fixed or maybe if a
    some old fighter pilot refuses to admit he is
    not as young as he once was.
    Email me on my web
    site so I can send you some ideas in private
    so I don't have others reading this and
    trying to use this to stop minor bucking that
    is more often caused by rider error and not
    by a life of abuse and years of training to
    buck.<br>
    <br>
    As for things to help this horse, hobble
    train him and have he wear hobbles every day
    so he learns to be restrained (the horse not
    your husband). Also do lots of
    tying this horse up where there is lots of
    activity, tie him at the busy place, during
    the busiest time. Expose him to
    lots and lots of sensory from people,
    machines, traffic, other horses, buildings,
    etc.. Have him wear a saddle a
    lot. Any time he out or tied or
    walking, saddle him up, after he gets good at
    that, tie things on the saddle, a sack of
    grain, a tire, boots, water jugs with water,
    anything that has weight, make him balance,
    make him carry a saddle and other weight so
    he will get desensitized to having weight and
    saddle on him. Make sure you
    prepare him for this and
    don't just throw it on him
    and make him buck and blow up, which he may
    do, but try and set him up with good pressure
    and release so he will accept this and not
    fight it, but if he insist on fighting it,
    let him. Tie him, put it on and
    let him blow, when he gets tired, walk him,
    round pen him, bring him back and tie him
    some more, he has to learn that bucking gets
    him nothing but tired. Over time,
    if you do this everyday, he will soon figure
    out, it is easier to not buck than to buck.
    Then you will be on your way.
    After he is good with hobbles,
    tie him and hobble him, it needed and then
    saddle and pile the weight on.
    The trick is to figure a way to
    secure thing to the saddle so it
    won't come off if he
    blows, he has to learn that blowing up does
    not get things off him, then he will see no
    point in doing it.<br>
    <br>
    Like your hubby, I love challenges like this,
    especially if someone tells me it
    can't be done, if it is
    too dangerous or I am too old. So
    since you can't stop him,
    help him, teach this horse bucking is hard
    work, bucking gets you nothing, and it is
    your choice. After you do all
    this, the chances of him doing with a person
    will be less and at least will be less
    forceful. I would NOT try and
    stop him from bucking, I would ignore it for
    a while and just pet him when he stops, then
    let him blow and pet when he stops, as he
    gets better on his own, then you can start
    correcting when he bucks and see if he
    respects your command to stop, then once you
    get him doing that, then your odds are better
    when you get on him and try to command him to
    stop. First you have to make sure
    he knows what you want when tell him to stop
    and at least know that he does know how to
    stop and will stop when you ask.
    The correction for bucking needs
    to be jerking the head to his butt, so when
    you are in the saddle and jerk or pull one
    rein, he will know what you want.
    Trying to teach this in the air
    is not a good plan, even for a pilot.
    There ain't no
    HUD on the back of a horse and the ejection
    seat tends to go out without much warning.
    I guess you could get him to wear
    a parachute but don't
    think he will have time to deploy it, but it
    might make you feel better.
    :)<br>

            <p>QUESTION: I am a 52 yr. old
            grandmother. I have been around horses
            all my life and have ridden almost
            everything. I bought a little spotted
            saddle horse, with the intentions of
            her being my "retirement" horse. She
            is a coming 6 yr.old. Had 30 days
            training at 3 yr.s old. Not ridden a
            whole lot. Was off for the last 20
            months after foaling. She is very
            sweet tempered and good on the
            ground. I rode her several times
            before purchasing her. I now ride her
            indoors in an arena, as right now in
            Wisconsin, it's too cold to be
            outside. She has never been ridden
            indoors. Last week, I tacked her up
            and walked her around the arena.
            After 10 minutes of walking, I
            decided to get her to move out.
            Supposedly she is gaited, and I
            wanted to see what she has. About 4
            strides into it, she started bucking,
            and then reared. I was taken by
            surprise, and I did get unseated. I
            got up and got right back on and rode
            some more, and put her into a trot
            with no problem. But, then I had to
            go to the ER, because I was spitting
            up blood. I now have 3 broken ribs,
            and a husband who wants me to sell
            her because he is afraid I'll get
            hurt again. I don't want to do that!
            The previous owner told me she bucked
            just one time; when she was coming
            out of a creek. She was 3. Other than
            that, no problems, other than she is
            very rough around the edges when it
            comes to reining, but she seems very
            eager to please, and willing to
            learn. I have put this mare through
            all kinds of things on the
            ground..walking over tarps and
            boards, exposing her to balloons,
            balls, opening an umbrella in front
            of her, dogs barking, plastic bags,
            all kinds of stuff, and she takes it
            in stride. The day she bucked there
            was nothing any different than it
            ever is. Same place to ride, same
            tack. 2 days before I had ridden her
            in the arena with other horses, and
            she did great. She never pins her
            ears, or shows agressive behavior.
            She is pastured with my other mare,
            an wise old 25 yr. old quarterhorse.
            She is never stalled. She is on very
            good quality hay, and gets grained at
            night.Other than just getting back on
            her to ride, right after I was
            bucked, I have not done anything with
            her, because my doc ordered me to not
            ride for 2 weeks. I am not afraid of
            getting bucked off, it's not the
            first time, but, at my age, it really
            sucks!!! I think this horse has great
            potential, and she has so many great
            qualities that I think she is worth
            another shot. When I go back to ride
            her, I would like some frsh ideas, or
            some tips on things I can do to show
            her that bucking is unacceptable.
            Thanks!!!!!

            <br>
            Well, I hear a lot of things and I
            have to disagree with a few of them.
            First this is not the
            horse's fault. You did
            not set this horse up for success.
            You rushed the horse, you
            took short cuts, got in a hurry and
            paid a price. Lucky you
            only got a few ribs broke, you could
            be dead or in a wheelchair.
            So feel lucky and don't
            get rid of the horse because of your
            mistake and your failure to take the
            time to make sure he was ready for
            what you asked him to do.
            I hear all the time about
            how good a horse is, how willing he
            is, how much he loves you, NONE of
            that matters. Your horse
            is a horse and that is all he knows
            how to be. He cannot
            throw you or hurt you unless you put
            yourself in a situation where it can
            happen. Don't blame the
            horse for anything, the horse has no
            choice in this, you bought him, you
            got on him, you went too fast, you
            did not prepare properly, you set the
            horse up for failure and the horse
            had no choice. <br>
            <br>
            It sounds like you did good sacking
            out, but this horse bucked from fear,
            pain or disrespect. I was
            not there so I can't say what caused
            it, but I can say that you caused it,
            you forced it and you make it happen,
            the horse had no choice.
            You and others may think
            the horse had a choice not to buck,
            and maybe he did, but he did not have
            a choice not to be there, he did not
            have a choice to tell you he was not
            ready, he probably did tell you he
            was not ready and you did not hear it
            or ignored it. Horse do
            things out of reaction when scared or
            not prepared. This horse
            told you he was not ready for what
            you asked, he told you the only he
            knew how. He did not
            throw you, you fell off, you failed
            to stay on, you did not have control
            of her, you did not read the signs
            before she bucked, you were not
            paying attention, I can always give
            10 reasons on how something was the
            persons fault and yet everyone still
            wants to blame the horse. If you get anything from
            my answer, you horse did nothing
            wrong and it was not her fault.
            Accept responsibility for setting up
            and causing this. <br>
            <br>
            So what do you do, you start from the
            ground up. You said you
            had all this experience, sorry but
            experience means nothing if you don't
            use caution, pay attention and don't
            set the horse up for failure.
            Once you admit that you
            caused this then you can start taking
            steps to prevent it and to set the
            horse for success. Horses like
            routine and habit. Do the
            ground work in a small area, teach
            the horse to be secure in this area,
            then do short rides in this same
            area, then do short rides at a walk,
            once the horse gets GOOD and walk and
            stops, then in a week or so do trots
            to walk, then walk to stop, the trot
            to stop, once the horse is good at
            that, then to trot to canter then
            back to trot, then canter to walk,
            then canter to stop, it all takes
            time to set the horse up to know what
            to expect, no surprises and routine.
            You said the horse was
            off for 20 months, that is a life
            time to a horse you basically got on
            a new horse that was never ridden and
            to quote you "I decided to get her to
            move out. Supposedly she is gaited,
            and I wanted to see what she has"
           WELL YOU SAW WHAT SHE
            HAS, not the answer you wanted.
           "If you get the wrong
            answer with a horse, you asked the
            questions wrong."<br>
            <br>
            If you were riding her bareback that
            may have caused bucks, no saddle
            means you butt bone is in direct
            contact with her spine, a saddle
            protects the spine and distributes
            weight better over a larger area of
            the horse, so not too much pressure
            is on one spot. The more
            you ride short rides the more the
            horse will get better and will not be
            so, what you call hot.
            She is just confused, and
            still testing each person since she
            got your fiance off, now she knows
            she can, so she will try more not
            with every person. Only
            put experienced and good riders on
            her in a small and enclosed arena or
            round pen so she will not want to run
            off or buck so much. Time
            is the key, the more you spend the
            better you both get.</p>

            <p>Slow down, start over and set the
            horse up for success. "If
            you take the time it takes, It takes
            less time".</p>

    <p>Easy Sparky!, if you read your email you
    said you had been around horses your entire
    life and have ridden everything.
     So please forgive me if I
    misunderstood this. As you not
    falling off a horse since you were 8 years
    old, I guess that record is past tense now.
    You now want to say the only mistake was
    believing what someone told you.
    Anyone that has been around horse
    people for a day or a year would know, that
    you put your life in your hands when you
    believe what others tell you, as you did.
     As for chewing your butt you see
    things as you want to see them, I did not
    call you names or even attempt to chew you
    out. You still want to see this
    as NOT your fault, you did nothing wrong but
    believe someone else is to blame.
    Sorry my dear, wrong again, you
    got on a horse that was not ready or safe and
    wanted to be "cowgirl or cowboy up" and like
    many people have found out, you are not as
    good as you think you are and a horse will
    show you that anytime you think so.
     There is not a horse in world
    that I ride that can't throw me, I know this,
    so I spend time and try and prevent it from
    happening.  NO one can make you
    look like an idiot, but you. So
    go ahead and keep believing that you did not
    fall off and that you decided to jump or got
    thrown. You hit the ground and
    could have been killed. How you
    got there is not real important.
    Why you got there should be your
    concern. And if you keep wanting
    to believe you did not fall off, you were
    thrown off, all you did was believe someone
    or it is my fault for telling you what you
    need to hear, so be it. I can not
    help people with egos that want to make this
    about them, their egos, whether they look
    like an idiot or who don't want to hear what
    they need to hear. Perhaps had
    someone told you this before, you would not
    have had to learn this lesson, I say that
    with reservation, since I am not sure you
    learned a lesson. The fact that
    you got back on the horse after it bucked,
    and were so proud of that fact, shows that
    you still believe the old tough girl/cowboy
    crap that gets people hurt and gets horses a
    bad name. <br>
    <br>
    Horses pay for people's mistakes.
    Your husband's first thought was
    get rid of the horse. Maybe he
    knows you better and figures you won't get it
    and will "get back on" "show the horse who is
    boss" and get yourself killed.
    <br>
    <br>
    You also said you had professional trainers
    tell you the same thing I told you but nicer.
    I ain't taking your money, you
    are not paying me and I am not in this to
    help people that don't want to listen, I do
    this to try and help HORSES! I
    don't think I can help your horse since he is
    stuck with you. So you do what
    you want, that has always been your option.
    I gave you my take on the
    situation from what you told me, if you don't
    like the answer, don't do it and don't ask
    the question. Your ranting
    response shows that you think you know it
    all, you will not accept that you caused this
    and will always find others or the horse to
    blame.</p><br>

    <p>From what you told me the horse is smart
    and is doing what horses do. He
    is telling you that he does not care about
    getting his ass run off chasing barrels or
    chasing cows. You can send this
    horse to 100 trainers, this problem has been
    caused by you and you can fix or give him to
    someone who wants a good horse just to ride
    and run and compete all the time.
    You call this his job, it is not
    his job it is you goals and your wants and
    you are using the horse get it.
     No horse wants to be ran and
    worked all the time. In earlier
    years of horses a horse was ridden more,
    spent more time with, cared for by the owner,
    and taken care of better since the horseman's
    life depended on it. A horseman would rarely
    run their horse at full speed from concern of
    hurting the horse and preventing it from
    being ridden. Now in the world of
    time, awards, medals and other prizes, all of
    which mean nothing to a horse.<br>
    <br>
    This horse may not like his job since it
    hurts, just because we can't see it or a vet
    can't find it, does not mean the horse is not
    in pain. I walk around with pain
    almost everyday, but not many know about
    unless I tell them. The horse may
    be telling you the only he can.
      Or he may just be saying enough
    is enough, I do not like getting kicked, ran,
    spurred, having the reins pulled on, or
    whatever it is that has made him sour to the
    ring.<br>
    <br>
    As I said at the start you owned the horse,
    you caused this behavior and only you can fix
    it.   You can't expect your horse
    to change if you continue to do the same
    thing.   By you not wanting to ride
    the horse, the horse gets what he wants.
      If the horse respected you and
    saw you a good fair leader then he would not
    buck.</p>
    <hr>
    It sounds like you have TRIED to give the
    horse what you think he needs, massages,
    training from stranger, medical check ups, I
    think the horse needs someone to see the
    world from his eyes, see how much fun it is
    living his life, some who thinks like a horse
    and if they were a horse would they want to
    be used or treated like he is being treated.
    People think giving a horse a good home, nice
    stall, blanket, good hay, good vet care and
    grain means they are being good to the horse.
      A horse would much rather be
    loved, spent time with relaxing and grazing
    like horses do in a herd.   None of
    that other stuff means much to a horse.<br>

    <p>Instead of continuing to send your horse
    away for strangers to force their will on him
    for months at a time, either change what you
    do with him and how you spend time with him
    or give him to a good home where a he can
    relax, be a horse and not have so many
    JOBS.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't enjoy riding him, how or why
    would expect him to enjoy having you ride
    him. You like many horse owners want to make
    this a horse problem.   It is not,
    your horse is horse and only a reflection of
    you and what you do to him.   The
    more you understand horses the more you
    understand yourself.   I say it all
    the , when people describe their horse, they
    describe themselves.<br>
    <br>
    Probably not the answer you wanted to hear,
    but that is my take from what you have told
    me.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Easy Sparky!, if you read your email you
    said you had been around horses your entire
    life and have ridden everything.
      So please forgive me if I
    misunderstood this.   As you not
    falling off a horse since you were 8 years
    old, I guess that record is past tense now.
    You now want to say the only mistake was
    believing what someone told you.
      Anyone that has been around horse
    people for a day or a year or more would
    know, that you put your life in your hands
    when you believe what others tell you, as you
    did.   As for chewing your butt you
    see things as you want to see them, I did not
    call you names or even attempt to chew you
    out.   You still want to see this
    as NOT your fault, you did nothing wrong but
    believe someone else is to blame.
      Sorry my dear, wrong again, you
    got on a horse that was not ready or safe and
    wanted to be "cowgirl or cowboy up" and like
    many people have found out, you are not as
    good as you think you are.   There
    is not a horse in world that I ride that
    can't throw me, I know this, so I spend time
    and try and prevent it from happening.
      NO one can make you look like an
    idiot, but you.   So go ahead and
    keep believing that you did not fall off.
      You hit the ground and could have
    been killed.   How you got there is
    not real important.   Why you got
    there should be your concern.   And
    if you keep wanting to believe you did not
    fall off, you were thrown off, all you did
    was believe someone or it is my fault for
    telling you what you need to hear, so be it.
      I can not help people with egos
    that want to make this about them, their
    egos, whether they look like an idiot, who
    don't want to hear what they need to hear.
      Perhaps had someone told you this
    before, you would not have had to learn this
    lesson, I say that with reservation, since I
    am not sure you learned a lesson.
      The fact that you got back on the
    horse after it bucked, and were so proud of
    that fact, shows that you still believe the
    old tough girl/cowboy crap that gets people
    hurt and gets horses a bad name.
      <br>
    <br>
    Horses pay for people's mistakes.
      Your husband's first thought was
    get rid of the horse.   Maybe he
    knows you better and figures you won't get it
    and will "get back on" "show the horse who is
    boss" and get yourself killed.
      <br>
    <br>
    You also said you had professional trainers
    tell you the same thing I told you but nicer.
      I ain't taking your money, you
    are not paying me and I am not in this to
    help people that don't want to listen, I do
    this to try and help HORSES!   I
    don't think I can help your horse since he is
    stuck with you.   So you do what
    you want, that has always been your option.
      I gave you my take on the
    situation from what you told me, if you don't
    like the answer, don't do it and don't ask
    the question.   Your ranting
    response shows that you think you know it
    all, you will not accept that you caused this
    and will always find others or the horse to
    blame.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>It sounds like you are doing ok.
      Don't let her get release when
    she bucks, she needs to get more pressure for
    bucking.   On my horseman tips page
    I talk about Bucking strap and nightlatch,
    put one on your saddle and it will help you
    ride out the bucks until you can correct her
    and put pressure on her to stop her.
      If you have one hand on the
    bucking strap, your other hand needs to work
    the one rein.   Pop it and get her
    to tilt her head to it, that way she cannot
    buck as hard and you will be making her think
    bucking is not good and gets her more
    work.<br>
    <br>
    If you have a round pen, put her in it, ride
    her at a canter, after a good warm up and get
    her out of this habit, this has worked for
    her in the past so she is trying it on you,
    run her butt off a bit and it will stop.
      If you don't have a round pen,
    put her in the smallest arena or enclosed
    area you have.   Ask for a canter,
    and as soon as she tucks her head, pull/hold
    ONE rein only, that will cause her head to
    tilt to the side so she cannot buck as good
    or as hard, keep that one rein tight until
    she gives and put her head up, all the while
    keep asking for the canter and put pressure
    to run, anytime her head goes towards the
    ground or tucks to buck, ONE rein only pull
    and tilt her head (pop it) until it comes
    back up.   After she runs a lap or
    so, let her walk, then trot and into a canter
    again, after a couple of canters with no
    bucks or head tuck, let it go for the day and
    do the same thing the next day in a few days
    it will go away.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> i am 24 years
    old, i have had my own horses since i was 9,
    they have all been backed but i have enjoyed
    schooling them to a higher standard. recently
    i have been helping out with a lovely 5 year
    old cob cross mare,she is in a feild with
    others at night then brought in at night and
    stabled. she has a lovely gentle nature and
    is great to handle in the stable. she was
    backed a year ago, by this i mean she was
    lunged and long reigned with no problems. she
    was great at first and took someone getting
    on her back in her stride. however that is as
    far as it went when asked to trot she shakes
    her head and starts to buck and rear this can
    be just from hearing a voice command to trot.
    i lunge her in her saddle with no problems
    but as soon as someone gets on her back and
    she is asked to trot either by the person
    riding or lunging she starts bucking. im at a
    loss as to what i should do, do you have any
    ideas?<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> It
    sounds like the horse is either confused or
    does not respect you.   Either way
    you need to spend more time confirming what
    you want from the horse so you are sure the
    horse is not confused.   If you can
    lunge on the ground then you should be able
    to lunge with a rider on.   If
    this horse understands your commands and
    instructions, then it should listen with or
    without a rider.   Make sure the
    horse is good without a rider, make sure it
    knows walk trot and canter cues well and does
    them consistently then add a rider with no
    reins, and no instructions from the rider,
    just have the rider to be a passenger, then
    lunge the horse as normal.   Most
    issues are fear or lack of respect, both
    create the other so make sure what is the
    real issue and help the horse find the right
    answer.   The horse is telling you
    something, either you are not clear, it is
    confused, it is scared, it does not respect
    you, something, so listen to the horse and
    help her find the right answer.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Q:   We rescued a little 3 to 4
    year old mare last year. She had been severly
    starved and abused. After almost a year she
    is a different horse but...<br>
    <br>
    In training her, we have come to realize that
    this mare was used as bucking stock and was
    abused afterwards. The most probable reason
    she was taken away from the bucking arena is
    that she falls over if you don't get bucked
    off.<br>
    <br>
    Other than bucking her out with a mannequin
    on top of her, which might not be good when
    she falls over, or using a live person who
    could get seriously hurt, do you know of any
    other options?</p>

    <p>A:   You have to teach this
    horse that bucking it the wrong answer and
    bucking only get her tired.   Do
    lots of ground work with saddle and if she
    bucks correct her, show her you can stop her,
    teach her what you do to get her to stop, so
    when you ride her she knows what you do to
    stop her, she knows that you can stop her and
    she knows bucking is not the right
    answer.<br>
    <br>
    If she is only 3 and was already used as
    bucking horse, she was started way too young
    and may be in pain from riding too early.
      let her grow and heal until five.
      In the mean time do lots of
    ground work, handling, and teach her that you
    are lead horse and leader, bucking is like
    kicking or biting, it is a sign of disrespect
    and resistance.   The more show the
    horse that you will not allow this, the less
    likely he will buck when you start riding
    him.<br>

    <p class="style3">First Horse - New Owner
    Question:</p>

    <p>Hi Rick, I am writing to get your thoughts
    and opinion. I've had several people at the
    barn tell me that I should sell Tino and buy
    an older and more trained horse because it is
    their opinion that he is too much for me as I
    don't have enough experience, and time to
    train him, etc. What are your thoughts? You
    have been around Tino and I wanted to know
    what your thoughts are. Do you think Tino and
    I are doing okay? Do you think I am capable
    of handling him and training him? Should I
    just ignore these people? I really want to do
    what is best for Tino, and just selling him
    off to someone because I'm a dumb-ass doesn't
    seem right. It seems selfish to me. He didn't
    ask me to buy him. I know you will be honest
    with me and I would really appreciate knowing
    what you think because I know how much you
    care about horses. Answer: For some reason I
    lost this email and just found it, sorry I
    did not get back sooner. This is tough one.
    Since it makes no difference to me and I have
    nothing to gain or lose, I can say keep him
    and forget what others say or I can say get
    rid of him since he young and you are not
    that experienced. But it is not that simple.
    Both you and Tino have something to lose and
    gain by your decision. As an experienced
    horseman I think Tino is a great horse and
    easy to work. Would I tell someone with
    little experience to buy him, probably not.
    Does that mean you should get rid of him,
    probably not. Should you keep him since I
    think he is good, probably not. You have to
    make this decision based of what you know, I
    can only give you information and what you do
    with it, how you use it and what happens in
    the future is all up to you. I rarely tell
    someone to get rid of a horse no matter what,
    I think if you buy a horse, you buy to entire
    deal and if you went too fast, did not think
    it through, did not do your homework or
    suddenly now think you are over your head,
    none of those reasons are good enough to make
    a horse pay for what you did. Now if this
    horse was attacking you, kicking you,
    breaking bones and you could not even lead
    him, then I might say it is better for the
    horse and you to get rid of him. I do not
    think you are in danger, unless you do
    something that puts you in danger, like
    taking Tino running down a busy hwy, that
    would be stupid and dangerous and then I
    would tell you that you are too stupid to own
    any horse. :) That is not the case. You
    called yourself a dumb-ass, all new horse
    owners are ignorant about the many aspects of
    horses, normal learning curve. If you jumped
    into a class in college on advanced physics
    and then called yourself a dumb ass, which
    would be the same situation. You, or anyone
    else can't expect to learn about horses in a
    year or two, that is why so many people fail
    with horses. Can you imagine going to Harvard
    and saying I want to have a Doctor's Degree
    in Space Travel in one year and then went
    out, bought a space ship and then got
    frustrated since you could not fly in your
    space ship? Same thing with a horse. In some
    way the space ship is easier since it is not
    living, fearful, survival driven, emotional
    and has a mind of it's own, like a horse
    does. So, when people claim to know about
    horses, give advice about how and what others
    should do with horses, it is really easy to
    pick out the ones that don't have a clue.
    Anyone that really understands horses knows
    it is not the horse that is dangerous. It is
    not the horse that has problems. It is not
    the horse that is the problem, it is the
    owner/operator/handler. In the horse world
    (of mostly women) the answer to problems is a
    different horse, a different saddle,
    different feed, different stalls, different
    equipment and everything but, taking the time
    to learn, grow and become a horseman. The
    first options are easy and fast, becoming a
    good horseman takes years of commitment,
    dedication, time, maybe a few hard knocks and
    investment. One way is easy and screws the
    horse over, the other way makes you better,
    teaches you many life lesson and makes you
    appreciate your horse, your accomplishments
    in horsemanship and teaches you more about
    horses than all the know-it-alls in the
    world. So it may sound like I am trying to
    talk you into keeping your horse, I am not. I
    don €™t want you to keep him
    from what I say or what I believe. Just like
    a don €™t want to MAKE a
    horse do something. I want to make a horse
    WANT to do something  €“
    very different than making him do it. If a
    horse wants to do something it is a choice,
    shows trust and understanding. If I make a
    horse do something it only shows I
    don €™t have the knowledge
    or understanding to help the horse to
    understand and to want to do it. When people
    listen to trainers or barn experts, they
    don €™t make educated
    decisions with commitment and dedication.
    Listening to others gets frustrated horses
    and horse owners, You making an educated
    decision gets people that want to learn, want
    to grow, want to become better for themselves
    and their horse. Another thing about people
    that are quick to say, get rid of that horse
    are the same people that send their horses to
    trainers, they buy horses that are old with
    lots of training, they search for bloodlines
    that produce calm horses, so they can be lazy
    and not take the time to learn. Then when
    something goes wrong, they can blame the
    trainer, blame the horse or the
    horse €™s past. They accept
    no responsibility for learning or investing
    the time, so they pass blame to others or
    then if they still fail they just sell their
    horse and get a
     €œbetter € one. I
    have owned a car almost my entire life, yet I
    could build one or fix one. Yet the first
    thing from most Barn experts is
     €œI have owned horses my
    entire life €. So that statement
    impresses others that
    don €™t know. You can have
    ten years experience or you have one year
    experience ten times, a very big difference.
    Owning a horse does not make a horseman
    anymore than owning a college would make you
    smart. I like most all horses and think they
    are all good, so me saying Tino is a good
    horse and I like him is not much a
    endorsement. Your future with him is entirely
    in your hands not mine, not his and damn sure
    not the people who are telling you to sell
    him. With that said, would you be safer with
    an older horse, maybe. Would you enjoy an
    older horse more, maybe. Could you get hurt
    on an older horse, sure. But all of this
    depends on you, what you do with the horses
    (regardless of age or training), what
    mistakes you make, what you do right or
    wrong, what you rush and go to fast, or if
    you took your time and invested time. It all
    comes down to you. Hope this helps, Rick
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    No one has a clue about owning a horse until
    they do it. Being a responsible horse owner
    means you do things to prepare, learn and
    increase your odds of success. Since a horse
    suffers because of what you do or don't do,
    when you take a horse, you should be somewhat
    prepared. I know way too many horse owners
    that want to save and love the idea of a
    horse, they have never picked a hoof, they
    don't own a horse trailer, they drive cars,
    they own no horse gear, most of all they have
    no understanding of the horse. To me that is
    unfair to the horse and sets them both up for
    failure. People think I am hard or too rough
    and direct with my answers. A horse does not
    have a voice, it is only a horse and that is
    all it knows and far too often people who
    mean well, who want to help and save a horse,
    end up getting seriously hurt or killed
    because they want to be nice and kind and
    when they get hurt or killed, someone wants
    to blame the horse and put the horse down. I
    see it far too often and don't have much
    patience for people that claim to love a
    horse and send the horse down a road of
    failure because they jump into something
    without having a clue. Understanding horses
    is not that difficult, but it does takes
    time, discipline, work, consistency, trial
    and error, money, and many other things, it
    is not like buying fish and feeding them once
    in a while. So my point is, being new and not
    having a clue means nothing to the horse, he
    does not care that you are new or the best
    horseman in the world, he is only a horse and
    that is all he knows how to be...it is your
    responsibility to learn his way, to
    understand him so you can help him. So
    excuses, you meaning well, you trying, you
    doing the best you can means nothing. This
    horse is going to be a horse regardless of
    what you do. The faster you get that, the
    better you both will be.

    Question: I was really looking for someone
    with medical knowledge who could help us. If
    you can't help, I understand. We have an old
    pony (about 20 years old) He is losing weight
    and can't gain any weight no matter how much
    we feed him. His coat hasn't shed in 2
    seasons. His stomach is contracting all the
    time and he has become so thin. There are not
    many vets around here that do house calls and
    we can't really afford the expense to pay one
    to come to our home. We have read online
    about cushings disease, but he is not showing
    all of those symptoms. Could you advise us in
    any way as to how to help our "gypsy". Thanks
    for your time. Answer:20 years is not that
    old. Lots of things can cause what you are
    seeing. Lack of exercise, lack of grass hay,
    bad teeth, not being wormed and many others.
    As horses get older they do not shed or grow
    hair as easy, so grooming is more important
    to help them. If his feet are not done he
    could be in pain so he walks less, which
    means he eats less and things go down hill
    from there. Answer: If this horse has all the
    grass hay the can eat, a flake of alfalfa
    once a day, some rolled or whole oats (2 - 3
    cups a day) some rice bran maybe a little
    sweet feed mixed in, this horse will put on
    weight. If you can't afford a vet, then maybe
    you are not providing enough of the right
    feed often enough. Also maybe you should find
    the horse a home where a vet is available.
    Putting on weight is not an overnight thing,
    it may take a few months, but just do it slow
    and don't try and do too much too fast or you
    can kill the horse. So do this: worm the
    horse have the teeth checked give lots of
    grass hay, 2 flakes morning and night (grass
    being Oat, Rye, Orchard, etc) give alfalfa
    hay a flake a day, half morning half at night
    give 2 cups of oats in morning and 2 cups at
    night give 1 cup of rice bran morning and
    night This horse will gain weight if you do
    what you need to do, you cannot just throw
    some low quality hay out once or twice a day
    and expect that to work. This horse should
    have hay out all the time so she can eat when
    she wants to and never be hungry and never
    have to wait for food.

    QUESTION: I recently purchased a 5 year old
    Belgian who came to me with poor ground
    manners. We have been working on teaching her
    that it is not ok to plow over humans on the
    lead and to stand in the cross ties, etc.
    These things are improving, although, she
    will still test her limits. She has, however,
    begun chasing children who come out to the
    pasture to retrieve their horses. She does
    not do this to me or other adults. She is
    very large, weighing over 2000 pounds, and I
    am concerned with the danger of this
    situation. Is there anything I should focus
    on in her handling to help alleviate this
    problem. I am not in the pasture to do any
    type of intervention when the chasing occurs.
    ANSWER: Like most problems, this is a people
    problem not a horse problem. A horse will not
    chase something that does not run. It the
    child cannot stop a horse from chasing it,
    maybe it should not be in the pasture with
    many horses. ONLY the person getting chased
    can stop this, not you. If you are there and
    do stop it, it means nothing to the horse. A
    horse will only respect someone it has too
    respect. You can tell the kid to keep a
    plastic grocery bag in her pocket and when
    your horse comes to shake it over her head at
    the horse. The problem is this is just a
    cheat and does not address the real problem,
    which is the kid that is letting your horse
    chase her, the kid is running from the horse,
    the kid is not showing the horse it can't
    chase her, the kid is causing the horse to
    chase her. All horses are bigger than people,
    it has nothing to do with size. Your horse
    may also be protecting the herd or wanting to
    play....it is obvious that you or the kid
    being chased does not understand horses or
    the way they think. This is perfectly normal
    horse behavior and anyone who understands
    horse would know this. If a horse kicked you
    when you took his food, you might see this as
    the horse is mean or the horse is possess of
    his food or he has a bad habit............ I
    would say it normal horse behavior.. A horse
    is only a horse and that is all it knows how
    to be, this is NOT a horse problem. Read my
    site it will help you see horses as they are
    and understand them better. ----------
    FOLLOW-UP ---------- QUESTION: This is both a
    people problem and a horse problem! I am
    fully aware that this can be normal horse
    behavior. I am also fully aware that it is
    most likely occuring because the child is not
    demonstrating to the horse that she is in
    charge. However, acting disrespectful to any
    human is not tolerated at our stable and this
    horse needs to learn this. I was simply
    looking for any suggestions you might have to
    assist this h orse in learning that she is
    always sub-ordinate to any human being. And
    size does make a difference. This horse is
    gigantic compared to the other horses in the
    pasture and kids who are normally confident
    in the pasture are intimidated by her, as are
    the adults. Even other horses who would
    normally be more dominant in the field are
    intimidated by her. And she was the bottom
    horse in the pecking order at her prior home.
    I have lots of experience with abused animals
    and have never identified an animal as mean.
    Anyone who works with animals on any regular
    basis would tell you that animals act
    instincively and don't have "mean" in their
    repertoire of behaviors. That is purely a
    human behavior. And I could care less if this
    is "normal" horse behavior. It is not
    acceptable to chase people out of your
    pasture - ever! I have reviewed your website.
    And I have to tell you that you rip on people
    who call their horses names but you do the
    same thing to people! Telling people they
    obviously don't know anything about horse
    behavior is the same thing as calling their
    horse stupid! It doesn't provide any
    solutions to the problem. You didn't tell me
    anything I didn't already know. But thanks
    anyway. Answer: OK, you are right, if you
    know so much and are so experienced, then why
    are asking me questions. This is not a horse
    problem, we can agree to disagree. I think
    you are wrong and 99% of all horse problems,
    including this one, is a people problem. This
    horse WILL not chase someone that does not
    run. And you are on such a high horse that
    you want to get insulted by answer. If you
    know all that you told me you, then why have
    you not fixed this? If you fix this, write me
    back and please explain how you can train a
    horse not to chase someone when you are not
    there and the other person runs and is scared
    of the horses. This will be a new revelation
    in horse training. You response reminds me of
    an old saying: "It is hard to get down from
    your high horse gracefully." And if you don't
    like my answers or my web site, feel free not
    to read or ask me questions and don't go to
    my site. See that is the wonderful thing
    about being a human, WE have choices and
    horses do not, which is why "it is never the
    horse's fault". Good Day!

    QUESTION: Hi, im hoping you might have some
    advice for me about my mares lameness. About
    4 years ago some 'fool' left the field gate
    open and all the horses ran loose around the
    surrounding fields.. my mare came back lame
    on the front left with no obvious reason (no
    cuts, swellings or heat etc) this went on for
    a couple of weeks so got the vet out, she was
    taken in for X-rays and all sorts of
    injections in her legs and anything the vet
    could think of (she was at the vets for
    roughly 2week) eventually the vet just said
    they had no idea why she was lame and that
    its perminant. After 5months of lameness she
    was sound again and fine to be ridden. I
    continued to ride her fine mainly hacking
    with some schooling or jumping for about 2
    years. Since then i've put her on loan a few
    times and shes gone lame from what i can
    gather this is why - 1st time on loan the
    loaner trotted her on roads for over an hour
    and she was then lame for 2months - 2nd tome
    on loan larger rider and constantly ridden in
    school bending on hardish ground and was lame
    for 4 months - 3rd time small rider ridden
    ridden only in school again and was lame for
    2/3months. Each time its the same leg shes
    lame on, i find that running cold water on it
    helps but as i said theres no heat or
    swelling. I was wondering if you have any
    idea as to what it could be or how i may be
    able to prevent it so she can be used more,
    at the moment shes hacked lightly and doing
    fine though. Shes only ever had a problem
    with being lame since the day she escaped 4
    years ago, before that i use to compete every
    weekend jumping showing xcountrys etc for 4
    years with no problem, shes 14.2hh and 14 now
    i got her when she was 5 she came from
    american adventure originaly sold on at
    4years to who i brought her off who broke her
    lightly and i brought her on from there with
    no problems. I know shes 3/4 quarter horse
    not 100% what the other 1/4 is. Sorry to
    ramble wanted to get everthing out. I
    understand not many replies are now given but
    any advice will be listened to and i will be
    greatfull although i also understand i may
    never get to the bottom of her lameness.
    Thanks for reading. Regards, Gemma. P.s i've
    uploaded a picture of her to show her weight
    and leg build. Shes the bay. image:
    Horses-702/2009/08/Tina.jpg ANSWER: There are
    two types of horses: Those that are hurt and
    those that will be hurt. My first thought is
    stop giving her to others so they can hurt
    her. She has a injury, jumping, running on
    hard ground and shoes are the worst things
    for this horse. You said when you left her
    alone she got better, no shit, she was not
    carrying an extra 150 lbs, she was not being
    run, she was not being jumped.... I can't
    imagine why she got better.... You asked for
    my opinion and I almost always take the
    horse's side. This horse can't tell you it
    hurts, just because you can't see pain does
    not mean she is better. I hurt a lot of the
    time when I some things and I don't limp or
    you would not know it. Just because she is
    not limping does not mean she is not hurting.
    Go do some jumping jack on the cement and I
    bet your feet, ankles or knees will hurt and
    you may not limp. I say stop jumping her
    absolutely. That is the worst thing for a
    healthy horse, it causing pounding,
    concussions, pressure and puts all 1000
    pounds on two small hooves with compounding
    force. Think about it a horse walks on four
    hooves to support their weight, you cut that
    support in half when you jump since the horse
    lands on two front feet.. if you don't think
    that is a big deal, go stand on a chair and
    you jump to the ground with only ONE foot for
    support, cut you support in half and maybe
    you will see how much pain it causes, once
    again, people forget or don't want to think
    like a horse. How often do you see horses
    running in the wild, not often. How often do
    you see them jumping, very rarely if ever. So
    we do these things 100 times more often and
    we add a saddle and the weight of a rider,
    run horses in circles and then wonder why so
    many horses have leg problems... it is pretty
    clear to me. You did not say and I hope you
    are not doing it, but a lot of people deal
    with this by giving bute to "ease" the pain..
    this is abuse in my book, you ride and work a
    horse in pain, so you give them drugs to hide
    the pain so the horse won't limp and then
    later the horse has 5 times the pain and just
    stands around hurting... So if you stop what
    you do, the will stop re-inuring this leg.
    What I say next is not the problem or will
    not fix the problem, and pictures can be
    deceiving, but the hoof looks trimmed too low
    in heel or too long in toe, which might be
    causing some discomfort and the front right
    hoof looks too long in the heel, almost
    club... but again some time pictures to not
    show what is really there, just something to
    look at.... not so you can give the horse to
    someone to jump or run her, I say this to
    maybe ease some of the discomfort for the
    horse. Rick ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------
    QUESTION: Thanks for your reply, shes not
    used for jumping or competing anymore hasnt
    been for a couple of years since she went
    lame again and i realised there could be a
    weakness so no worries there, just ridden
    once a week now if that on a hack which lasts
    no longer than an hour baring in mind i only
    walk with some trot. She loves being hacked
    her ears are forward the whole time i wouldnt
    want to stop doing that unless it really was
    bad for her. Also it keeps abit of weight off
    her as she gets really large and is prone to
    lami. Shes on no drugs although i do think
    the vet put her on some when she was at the
    vets 4 years ago. She shows no sign of pain
    or discomfort other than the lameness but as
    u said she may not show it. As for the hoofs,
    i have no idea what they should look like ive
    always trusted my farrier so ill mention
    that. Thanks again for your response.
    Answer:You're welcome. Riding for weight
    control and short non stressful rides are
    great...Listen to the horse it will tell you
    lots of things, most are to busy doing and
    never listen. Exercise is good, no shoes are
    good, and not over weight is good. If your
    shoer, farrier or what you call him
    understand barefoot horses and barefoot
    mechanics then he will know how to trim. Some
    farriers that mainly do shoes, do not
    understand the difference between a barefoot
    trim and a shoe trim, so they just trim the
    same way. A good barefoot trimmer knows the
    right way to barefoot trim. Not to say your
    trimmer does not know, but ask questions,
    educate yourself on the hoof and trims, so
    you can ask good questions and know if you
    are getting BS or good answers, ask other
    farriers for their opinion..... two good
    horse sayings are: **You don't as a barber if
    you need a haircut and you don't ask a
    farrier if your horse needs shoes.... The
    second is: **No hoof, No horse...(take care
    of the feet they are very important) Rick
    Lots of people do clicker training with
    horses, some videos on youtube about it you
    can watch. I trained dogs in the military for
    several years, so that understanding helps me
    with horses. However, there are big
    differences in horses and dogs. Dogs are
    predators like us and horses are prey, they
    flee and learn on release. Horses also push
    and try to move up and only respect a higher
    and stronger leader. Praise does not work on
    horses like dogs. Praise to a horse is
    RELEASE. Very important and hard to learn and
    use. To tell a horse yes, or that something
    is the right response I want, you need to
    release, fast and timing, but release
    teaches, release of pressure. EVERYTHING IS
    PRESSURE to a horse, a look, a stance, facing
    them, touching them, talking to them, all
    pressure. That is why talking interferes with
    training. Horses do not talk, they
    communicate with body language, pressure and
    release. Really do lots of research on Herd
    Behavior so you understand horses. Food works
    for tricks and to help a horse understand
    what you want, but for riding and long term
    food is not what makes good horses, strong,
    consistent, fair and understand is what
    teaches horse best. As for your horse racing
    training. Assume the horse has none and start
    from scratch. If you treat this horse like he
    knows nothing you will ensure you identify
    what he knows and that way you teach him the
    right things so you can ensure a good
    consistent foundation. You always want to a
    good safe place to move back to, if you don't
    start at the beginning you will not have a
    place to take him when he gets lost or
    confused. This horse may have been ridden but
    only to run fast on an enclosed track where
    it could not go anywhere but in a circle. If
    you get on this horse and think that it knows
    how to give to pressure, how to turn, stop or
    look to you for direction, you will be hurt
    and surprised. This horse knows nothing and
    what ever it has been taught has been wrong
    and only creates confusion to the horse.
    Confusion makes fear, fear makes lack of
    trust, that puts a horse in reaction mode,
    fear, flight mode and then you get thrown,
    hurt and scared and all your progress goes
    back tenfold. The slow way is the fast way
    with horses. Read my entire site so you
    really understand a horse and see the world
    as a horse sees it. The is not a dog and does
    not care or need you, it wants to stay alive
    and wants to know what is going to happen
    next so it can feel safe. And no, do not ride
    or work this horse 200 pounds underweight,
    let it get some weight, muscle, feel out the
    new home and surroundings.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As for you already "mothering" this horse,
    you are on a road to failure. This horse does
    not need you to protect it, to bring it food,
    to keep the chickens, sheep, birds or wolves
    off it, it has survived for millions of years
    and has done well without you protecting it's
    food. It will learn to push the chickens and
    sheep on its own, just like it will learn to
    push you..... don't be fooled that this horse
    will love you or need you or want to protect
    you or wants to be your friend..... it will
    only like you and tolerate you if you push
    it, show it you are boss and act and talk to
    it like a horse. Watch my videos, you will
    think my horses love me.... they do not, they
    tolerate me and respect me so they allow me
    to do what I want, not because of love, not
    because I give them a carrot, but because
    they know I am in charge, I can make them,
    they have no choice, and they see me as the
    strongest leader......... NOT LOVE sorry, I
    know this is a shocker for most.. :) Good
    luck and pay attention, I assure you, your
    horse is paying attention and learning your
    weakness. //END// Follow up: I am direct,
    many say I wear my feelings on my sleeve, you
    know what I thinking by looking at me, this
    works very well with horse and very bad with
    people. A horse does not want nice or mean,
    that means nothing, they want specifics, they
    want to clearly know who is in charge, who
    the leader and who they have to respect. This
    is how a horse finds security and safety. My
    goal is not to make you feel bad, no more
    than a horse is trying to hurt you when it
    kicks you. It may be the end result, but I
    call it like I see it and a horse kicks to
    tell someone it means what it says. Neither
    is mean or have ill intent, it just is. The
    fact that you think I make you feel bad or
    that a horse is mean or wants to hurt is what
    YOU see. It does not make it so. A horse is
    not stupid or smart, it is not mean or nice,
    it is not aggressive or passive, it is a
    horse. All horses kick, all bite, all groom
    each other, all look for comfort. A horse is
    only the reflection of who handles it. If a
    horse does right, good or whatever you want
    to call it, it is because the person
    communicated good, and made it easy for the
    horse to find the right answer (no right and
    wrong in a horse's mind) People want to make
    all these terms to help themselves and make
    them seem smart and make it easier on them to
    cope with what they see in a horse. It is all
    misunderstanding of the horse. Calling a
    horse names just gets my goat and pisses me
    off. I always tell people that those who call
    their horse names are really describing them
    self. If you see someone call a horse stupid,
    stubborn, crazy, hard-headed, mean, scared,
    jumpy, insecure.....look at the person and I
    assure all those terms will fit.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A whip is a cheat (see my article on cheats).
    If you depend on it, have to have it, and use
    it all the time, you don't understand what a
    cheat is. Other common cheats are lead ropes,
    halters, saddles, carrots, grain, hay and
    many others. You should not be in a position
    where you cannot do something with a horse if
    you loose your cheat. People ride horses
    bridleless, no head gear and bareback, no
    saddle, there is not cheats there, unless the
    person wears spurs and can't ride without
    them. You are still looking at horse problems
    as horse issues. It is not. A horse does
    fine, makes no mistakes, and lives great when
    no humans are around them or involved. A
    horse does not ask or need your help, in
    fact, most human contact is nothing more than
    an annoyance and creates work for the horse,
    so why would they like that, they are very
    clam animals to survive, they conserve their
    movement for eating, playing and learning and
    running from predators. It is against all
    instincts to run for no reason, so we humans
    chase them to get them to move. A horse has
    to know "what is in it for the horse" Stop
    looking at horses as a pet, a tool or a dumb
    animal that is here to amuse you or for you
    to use as you see fit. Look at them as a
    HORSE. That is what they know, that is what
    they are, that is where they come from. Once
    you know them, understand them, act like them
    and become them, then you will stop fighting
    with them, forcing them, blaming them and you
    will both grow. The next time a person calls
    a horse stupid, inform them that a horse as
    the brain of a walnut and is much lower in
    the evolutionary scale than humans. So if
    humans are so much more advanced than horses,
    who is the stupid one, the horse or the human
    that can't even get a walnut brain to do what
    he wants. Your question screams of confusing
    and frustration, both terms I would use to
    describe your horse and I have never met
    either of you. You are confused and
    frustrated since you don't understand or
    think like a horse. Everything I have said
    here is on my web site, so I tried of
    re-typing it just to make it easier on
    someone who does not want to make time to
    read and study the site. Much like horses get
    tired of people that confuse them, hit them
    and don't understand them. I have spent
    enough time telling you to read my site, your
    next question needs to be directed to what
    you read on my site and that you don't
    understand what it says or what it means. If
    being a good horseman was easy, everyone
    would do it and be good at it.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q: I €™ve been around
     €œcowboys € for
    much of my life. This includes ropers, rodeo
    folks, barrel racers, etc. NONE of them ever
    does groundwork. I keep hearing more and more
    about groundwork, but I find it mind numbing
    and BORING. Do you do groundwork? If yes, how
    often and how long? A: Not all cowboys
    understand or know horses. That is how the
    term  €œCowboy
    Up € came about. If you
    don €™t what you are doing,
    just cowboy up and hand on. As for ropers,
    rodeo folks and barrel racers, I think you
    are confusing horsemen with these people. You
    will rarely see any horsemanship skills at
    these events, what you see is people that
    want to win, people that are competitive and
    people that don €™t care
    much for their horse, they just use their
    horse for their needs. Now that I have pissed
    off some people reading this, what and why is
    ground work needed €¦. Read
    some books on it to really understand it.
    Basically, and very briefly, if you
    understand horses, know the way they think,
    then you understand the importance of ground
    work. It is nothing more that spending time
    with your horse, doing horse things, learning
    your horse, showing and proving to your horse
    that you know what you are doing, you
    understand pressure and release, you know how
    to talk horse, you show the horse you are a
    strong and knowledgeable leader, you dominate
    the horse in a non-threatening way, you move
    the horse, you control his movement, you
    control his direction, you can stop him, you
    develop cues that the horse learns to
    understand, you teach the horse how to read
    you and what you want and how you ask for it.
    You determine where the weaknesses are in you
    and your horse, you see what happens when you
    push too hard or the wrong way. All of this
    improves you ability to read and understand
    your horse, ground work helps you, it makes
    you learn from your horse, if puts you in a
    position of advantage and safety so your odds
    of success is enhanced, which helps the horse
    since when you fail your horse fails. So when
    people tell you they don €™t
    do it or see a need for it, you will know,
    that they do not know or understand the way
    of the horse.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ok, it sounds like you have done a lot of
    things but look at this from the horses point
    of view and change what you are doing. I am
    not a fan and don't believe in People that
    talk to horses and then tell owners what the
    horse said. I think they are rip off people
    and just take advantage of people looking for
    answers in all the wrong places. You keep
    making this a horse problem and I see it as a
    You problem. I could be wrong but I think if
    I took this horse out and worked it for about
    30 mins you would see a different horse. Any
    time you put inexperienced people on a horse
    that don't know what they are doing, the
    horse pays, he gets confused, he gets very
    inconsistent cues, he pays for every mistake
    each new person tries and learns, this gets
    very old very fast, soon the horse stops
    trying to look for the right answer, cannot
    learn since every rider does something
    different and the rules keep changing, so the
    horse gives up, it stops trying to learn and
    learns to stop trying, it gets called sour,
    it gets called difficult, mean, stubborn and
    other names. Horses are forced into their
    lives with no say, they get no choice in who
    owns them, who rides them, they can't talk so
    when people don't know how to handle them
    they just struggle every day not knowing what
    to expect, what will happen next, and live in
    constant confusion and fear, confusion
    creates fear and uncertainty, this creates
    anxiety, which eventually creates resentment
    (sour), so the horse is always adjusting will
    then try and resist all handling, all riding,
    all people. It is a sad and horrible life for
    a horse since they are so willing and really
    just try and get along with the life they are
    dealt. You think since you do good with four
    other horses, then this problem must be this
    horse's fault, I don't believe this. I think
    the other four horses have accepted their
    life with you for some reason, either you do
    work with them as much, the same way, what
    ever the reason, all horses are different,
    all horses need to be handled within their
    abilities. People want every horse to adjust
    to their abilities and when they don't they
    label the horse. Most horses called difficult
    are really smarter, they have got smarter
    from poor or bad handling by various people
    that did not know what they were teaching but
    taught many bad lessons and over time the
    horse learns that they are stronger, they are
    bigger, they can win and defeat people that
    don't know, so they are actually making the
    horse into what the horse becomes. There are
    way too many horses with a past and then they
    have no future. Their past is made for them
    by people that don't know and their future is
    doomed by more people that don't know.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    You say the horse does not do the same
    problems when you ride, of course not. You
    know how to ride so the horse knows this and
    knows it gets consistent cues from you, so it
    knows what you want and gives it to you, your
    students do the opposite and the horse gets
    tired of it. You have owned this horse since
    it was three and then tell me it was very
    immature, no shit, it is only a baby, a three
    old is like a 7 year old kid, very young and
    learning, a young horse needs to be handled
    right so it can grow. The horse is 11 and you
    had it since three, which means you have
    eight years to screw this horse up or to make
    it a great horse, you can judge yourself what
    kind of job you did. But don't blame the
    horse either way, if it is good you did good,
    if it is bad, you did bad. I don't think of
    horses are good and bad, they are just
    products of their handling. You talk about
    this horse shooting out of a box (a trailer),
    that tells me this horse has your number, he
    knows you are not the boss and he can do what
    he wants, he has learned you for eight years
    and knows what he can do, what you can't do
    and what you can't stop him from doing, so he
    does what he does because of what you do or
    can't do. A horse is only a reflection of
    it's owner and when you get a young horse at
    three you only have you to blame if the horse
    turns out bad (not listening, not respecting,
    refusing to give in, etc). You need to stop
    making this about the horse and make it about
    you. Change what you are doing and your horse
    will change. The horse is stressed and
    depressed since he does not know the rules,
    you are looking for answers in all the wrong
    places and are constantly trying something
    new and different/inconsistent to try and fix
    the horse and the problem is you are not
    being a strong leader and giving this horse
    good clear direction so he knows you are in
    charge and he has to listen to you. A horse
    feels better when they have a leader that
    TELLS them what to do. They do not do good
    when they have a bad leader that loves them,
    that tires to be nice, that keeps trying and
    never succeeds, that thinks somehow by asking
    and not making, the horse will somehow love
    them back and suddenly become the horse they
    dream about. This horse is in a bad place
    with YOU. Stop making excuses for his
    behavior and become a strong leader, give
    specific direction and accept nothing less,
    make the rules clear and don't change them
    for the horse, push this horse so he knows
    you will not give up, you will not stop and
    be nice, but will be consistent, direct and
    assertive. Once you change, your horse will
    change. He could have already been what you
    call trust worthy. You want to see this horse
    as a horse with a past. This horse is a
    horse, treat him like a horse and not like a
    horse with a past. It sounds like you are
    babying him. 30 to 45 days is more than
    enough time to get a horse over these issues.
    You said it took 3 months to stop him from
    trying to kick you when you went in the
    stall, it should have took about 15 or 20
    mins. Somethings you don't want to rush and
    take your time, but there comes a point that
    if you continue to take your time the horse
    knows and thinks you are a weak leader. Turn
    up the heat on this horse and stop being so
    easy. You think this horse trust you, I think
    this horse tolerates you. If he respected
    you, he would not still be doing these
    things.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Like I tell 99% of the people, most horse
    problems are people problems, they are caused
    by people, then continued by people, or make
    worse by people. In the same way, they can be
    fixed by people, they can be prevented by
    people, and can be improved by people, but
    only if the person really understands horses.
    Everyone wants to use "natural horsemanship"
    techniques (love, caring and easy training)
    the problem is natural horsemanship does not
    work if you don't understand a horse and if
    you are not willing to treat a horse like
    another horses treats them. Horse kick each
    other and bite each other and chase each
    other, that is what they do. That is how they
    learn who is higher and who they should trust
    and follow. Only then will they groom each
    other, rub on each other and be friends. The
    problem is most horse owners what the love,
    rub and friends part and are not willing to
    do the kick, bite and chase part....IT JUST
    DOES NOT WORK. No I am saying to kick a horse
    or bite a horse, but you can accomplish the
    same thing by moving a horse, putting
    pressure, making a horse respect you and your
    space when you tell him to, but will only do
    that if you are willing to enforce it. Most
    just threaten to enforce it and the horse
    knows this and learns this and then slowly
    starts treating you like a lower horse. A
    never ending cycle of confusion for the
    horse. Make yourself better and this horse
    will get better, this horse is only a
    reflection of you and what you require of
    him.

    Question: Our horse is so badly bitten by the
    others in the paddock that we've stopped
    riding him because the saddle rubs the wounds
    raw. Any suggestions? Answer: You did not
    provide the requested information. With what
    you told me, build a wall around your
    paddock, put up hot wire, move the horse out
    of the paddock, make sure it is big enough so
    the horse can move away from the horses, sit
    in the paddock and stop the other horses,
    wrap the horse is foam, move the
    horse............ you ask this like I can fix
    this over an email, not sure how you see this
    as a behavior issue, sounds like a people
    issue where the horse pays.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question: I am 49 years old and have owned
    horses all my life. I have however never
    raise a colt. I have a new appaloosa stud
    colt, I was with him when he was born and he
    just turned 4 weeks old. I have made it part
    of my daily routine to pet him and scratch
    him, in an attempt to gain his confidence.
    Today, I rubbed a foal halter on his mother
    and then on him. He stood quietly while I
    slid it up over his nose. When I started to
    fasten it he started jumping and struggling.
    I instinctively held on and let him fight it
    out for 30 seconds or so and he settled down
    and let me handle him any way I wanted to.
    Did I do this right or is he too young?
    Should I repeat this or should I leave the
    halter on him awhile. The mare and colt run
    freely from barn to pasture. I believe it is
    relatively snag proof. Your advice would be
    greatly appreciated. Answer: It sounds ok to
    me, I would not have tried to put it on all
    the way, the horse let you put put in on, you
    should have taken that as a try and removed
    it so the horse could get release. By holding
    and trying to too fast you crated fear and
    got in a situation where the horse had to
    struggle. Had you touched the nose with it
    and then removed it and then touched it
    higher and removed it and then put it on and
    removed it, several times, the colt would
    never have struggled, it would have known
    what to expect and would have gotten used to
    it and not feared it.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question: I am 38 years old and have been
    riding weekly for 2 months. I had a lot of
    fear when I started from bad experiences as a
    child when riding. I fell off a horse last
    week and my teacher, knowing my background,
    decided to put me on the horse that I am most
    comfortable and bonded with when riding.
    Yesterday my horse sat down when me on her
    three times during the trail ride. This was
    upsetting to me since having my experience
    with falling off a different horse the week
    prior. This was the first time this horse has
    ever showed this behavior. Why did the horse
    do that? This horse is in a herd of 15 other
    horses and spends time in a stall and a
    pasture. My teacher said that she spent more
    time in the stall this past week than in the
    pasture. Please help me understand. Answer:
    lol, could be lot so things, but what is was
    not was he was not being mean, he was not
    trying to hurt you, the was not being bad.
    There are so many reasons this could have
    happened, but my guess would be it was hurt,
    out of shape or weak from not being ridden or
    it was confused was getting conflicting cues
    and signals from you so it did not know what
    to do or it knew that you were nervous and
    scared and felt that you were tense and not
    relaxed so maybe in this horse's past he sat
    down one time and the rider got him, so he
    remembered and decided to try it with you...
    my guess is you got off him like you were
    running from a burning building and a little
    light went in on his head, and bell went
    "Ding" and he said holy cow, I just figured
    out how to get this girl off me, so he did it
    again, and my guess is you got off again and
    so the lesson goes, he trained you to get off
    when he laid down.... They don't call horses
    "professional people trainers" for nothing...
    :) If you want to teach a horse to do
    something make it comfortable for them, if
    you want to teach them NOT to do something
    make it uncomfortable for them. So when you
    get off, you make him comfortable. When a
    horse sits of TRIES to lay down with me, I
    make him very uncomfortable, I squeeze, I
    yell, I raise my hands, I wiggle in the
    saddle, shake my legs, I act like I just won
    the lottery and the horse goes holy crap, I
    better not lay down my rider just went
    crazy... and then we walk off for a nice
    ride... :)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question: I am 43 years old and have been
    riding since I was 11. I worked and trained
    for a couple of facilities in my 20's mostly
    in the Arab world. I showed in reining and
    working cow classes myself but then went on
    to just being a horse enthusiast and enjoying
    my horses out on the trails and doing some
    penning with friends. My horses are now 21
    and 24 years old and have been in pasture the
    past 7-10 years. They are sound and healthy
    and was wondering now that my daughter is 12,
    is it wrong to pull my 21 year old gelding in
    from pasture and spend some time with him in
    the saddle again so my daughter can enjoy
    him? What are the pro's and cons? My daughter
    is a beginner rider having taken lessons and
    been out on the trails. She would just be
    doing some basic arena work learning to walk,
    jog, lope and learn some basic fundamentals.
    I would love to pull him in for the summer
    for her so she has her own horse instead of
    always using someone else's. Please give me
    some advice and direction on doing something
    like this and if it is advisable. Answer:
    Lots of options and lots of unknown. The 21
    year old would be better since the 24 is
    getting up there, but it would depend on
    temperament, ability, attitude of horses, how
    much time you spend re-teaching, how much
    resistance the horse shows when ridden again,
    how willing your daughter is (your idea or
    hers) does she want to just run and jump or
    does she realize that the horse is old and is
    just an easy ride. You know the horse, you
    know a whole lot more info than I do. The old
    saying, "young troopers need old horses" this
    has been around years since older horses tend
    to be lazy, less likely to run off, buck or
    hurt a young inexperienced rider. Older
    horses tend to be less flighty and less
    likely to want to fight. However, this old
    horse has not been ridden every day and has
    not been exposed to the same things that
    older horses that are ridden everyday have.
    You could bring this horse out and it could
    allow you ride, be soft and show no
    resistance since it knows you and then may
    change with your daughter. I would teach your
    daughter to work it on the ground, spend time
    with it, develop a relationship, see how they
    act together, you will see if problems like
    pushiness, aggressive, biting or kicking
    happens. Or if they bond like each other and
    become friends. Too often people think you
    can pick a path with a horse and then they
    get stuck since they are unwilling to change
    as the horse or situation changes. Too many
    variables, each next step will depend on what
    happens at each step. So to try and guess at
    the results at the end is impossible, since
    the will be determined by what is done with
    the horse at each step of the way. Go slow,
    start like the horse has never been ridden,
    don't over work or push too hard, build a
    good foundation and decided what to do after
    you do this... You did what many do, you did
    not break it down to little steps with lots
    of release and repetition so the horse would
    know what to expect and never would have
    become confused and scared. You created fear
    instead of removing it. Not a great lesson,
    but no one got hurt so not a bad day.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It €™s funny, I would think
    more women would be more compassionate about
    this topic. If my wife was pregnant I would
    have the attitude  €œExercise
    if good for you so go cut the
    grass €. It probably would not
    hurt her to cut the grass but most women I
    know, who are or have been pregnant,
    don €™t feel good, have
    swelling in the joints, pain in the internal
    organs, pressure in parts of the body they
    did not know they had and not to mention you
    have emotions and hormones in play more. I
    try and look at horse €™s
    like it was me. If I was a horse, what would
    I want? I agree light riding will not
    necessarily hurt a pregnant mare. However,
    when a mare if pregnant they gain weight,
    this puts more pressure on joints, legs and
    body. So even when a horse can carries a
    rider normally it is putting pressure on the
    back, legs and joints. Now you add the weight
    of being pregnant and you increase the chance
    of causing lameness. Pregnant mares have a
    higher chance of lameness just by being
    pregnant, now you throw the weight of a rider
    and you increase the chance of causing
    lameness. If you end up causing lameness then
    the mare could be confined to a stall which
    is not good for her the baby and could cause
    her to abort if the lameness was serious
    enough. If the horse gets started, trips, or
    spooks or falls it could cause or increase
    the chance of a miscarriage. Pregnant mares
    sometime get cinchy due to their girth is
    sensitive and it is uncomfortable. Since this
    sounds like your first pregnant mare, make
    sure you check the wormer you are using, some
    are good for pregnant mares and can harm the
    foal. I will agree that exercise is good,
    nice long walks, good pasture turn out and
    not stalled is all good for the mare. A
    general rule is if you ride at all, make it
    light, slow and non-stressful. And only ride
    for the first two trimesters and no riding in
    the third. In horses, the baby stays
    relatively small until the third trimester
    when the foal really grows. If I was
    pregnant, I know I have no experience in
    this, but if, I would not think I would want
    to be ridden that much, but would enjoy
    walks, grazing and maybe light short rides.
    Here is a good link to review about pregnant
    mares.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A tom bit is the worst bit out there, it is
    very painful and confusing to a horse. Head
    tossing is normally caused by a horse looking
    for release or hard hands on the reins. (I
    have an article on a TThumb bit on my article
    page, it will explain why this bit is so bad)
    Ride the horse with just a halter I bet it
    stops. A tie down is another cheat for trying
    to fix the horse and not fixing yourself.
    When you get better your horse gets better.
    Have a good experienced rider try and ride
    the horse if the head tossing stops then that
    will confirm it is you. I have ridden many
    head tossers and then I ride them and it
    stops. I am soft on the reins and pay close
    attention to any pressure I give on a rein.
    This is also caused by insecure riders who
    are scared and tend to ride tight reined and
    want to hold the horse back since they think
    it will run off, this will get a horse to
    toss as well. First a light tom thumb is like
    saying I saw a light elephant. The TT bit is
    one of the worst pain producing bits out
    there. Many people think it is a snaffle and
    it is not. It is a leverage bit with a break
    in the mouth piece, but most people think
    since it has a break that it is a snaffle. If
    I could get rid of the worst bits the TT
    would be one of them. A twisted wire snaffle
    is a snaffle but one of the worst snaffles
    for pain. It causes it pain. I don't blame
    this horse for running, he wants the rider
    off and wants the pain to stop. So it makes
    perfect sense what he is doing. I always tell
    people that if you can't ride your horse in a
    halter, then you should not be riding it in a
    bit. A halter ensures you know how to control
    the horse without pain, it makes you learn to
    communicate with the horse verses make him do
    things with pain. I don't use bits, don't
    promote them and whenever I work with a horse
    the first thing that goes is the bit and then
    I get to the other issues, which normally
    immediately become less as the bit goes away.
    Now I know that any bit can be soft or hard,
    depending on who is hold the reins, so the
    other rider you talk of may be scared or
    nervous of the horse, so her fear causes her
    to hang on and pull the bit harder thinking
    that is how she can control him, this is a
    mistake of many riders, new and old. A bit
    does not control a horse, never did and never
    will, a horse will run with a broken jaw and
    bloody lips and will ignore pain if they
    think their life is in danger. Pain = fear =
    reaction = run that is the way of the horse.
    This is not a horse problem. I have a great
    article, by someone else on the TT bit on my
    articles page of my web site:
    http://www.thinklikeahorse.org/horsearticles.htm
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ANSWER: Ok, don't take this wrong, but you
    are very young, so when you say you have been
    around horses your whole life, that really is
    not very long. Even if you were around horses
    when you 2, 5, 9, you are not learning
    horses, you are just being around them, maybe
    sitting on them. I tell people what I am
    about to tell you and they 40, 50 or 60, so I
    will tell and it is even more so. You don't
    know much about horses and the fact that you
    think you have all this experience only gets
    in the way of you learning more. I can
    guarantee you this is you causing all this.
    You have look at this horse like a horse, not
    your possession, not you property, not your
    thing to order around and control and make it
    do what you want. This is hard for younger
    people. Everything you do with this horse,
    you look at it as if you were a horse, would
    like it? Just running around an arena is very
    boring and most horses hate it. Jumping is
    very hard on horses, it hurts their feet and
    legs and they don't like it. Horses hardly
    ever jump in the wild, they run around
    things, by jumping they risk falling and
    hurting a leg and they know that means death
    in the wild, so horse don't jump, are not
    made for jumping and it hurts them now and
    later in life. You say you put leg on the
    horse when it does not want to go and it
    kicks, I forgot to ask if you wear spurs or
    use a whip, this just makes the problem
    worse. You are not looking at this horse as a
    partner or friend and working buddy, you are
    trying to show him who is boss, force him to
    do things and make him listen, this is
    probably what you have been taught. I would
    suggest you work on being a horsewoman, learn
    the horse, learn how it thinks and lives in
    the wild, without people, try and connect
    with your horse as another horse, not as an
    owner or master. These problems can go away
    overnight and it is up to you. If you read
    and learn more about horses, then you will
    understand how to treat them better so they
    will give you what you want without you
    making them or forcing them. As I said
    earlier, you are young and lots of time to
    learn, but this horse is being a teacher, a
    horse is the best teacher of the horse, try
    and listen more to what he is trying to say
    and stop trying to make her listen and make
    her do things, then you will see a big
    change. If you want your horse to change, you
    have to change. After all, you said you ride
    the horse, and the problems started and
    happen when you handle or ride the horse, so
    you are causing the reactions and actions of
    the horse, when you get better, your horse
    will get better.

    lol, you sound like you are doing a lot and
    it sounds like maybe too much. Your free
    choice hay idea is good, but I would just put
    two or three flakes in the morning and see
    how long that last, then at night, if it is
    all gone then put four flakes, when a horse
    gets enough food they will get picky and will
    only eat the good stuff and leave stems, so
    if he is picking and leaving food then too
    much, if he is almost eating everything, then
    you are good. As for NEEDING to put on
    weight, ease up, it takes a long time for a
    horse to get really thin, then people, mainly
    women, get this horse feel sorry for them and
    try and feed the crap out of them and can
    shock the system, it is worse to go from no
    food and then excess fat food to quickly. The
    US found this out when we sent too much milk
    to a deprived country and all the kids were
    dying from the mild since it shocked their
    system to fast. Horses put on weight slowly,
    let it take it's time, with feed and just
    about everything else with horses, "THE SLOW
    WAY IS THE FAST WAY" The horse is under
    weight from neglect, with just getting fed
    normal and good hay, he will put his weight
    back on in time, DON'T TRY AND FIX THIS IN A
    MONTH, you will cause other problems with
    this horse. Too much grain and fatty food is
    not good, so a few "cups" in the morning and
    few at night (no more than 3 each feeding)
    will be more than enough for this horse.
    "Less is more with horses" Make sure he has
    been wormed, make sure he has a salt block,
    and get him some exercise, people want to
    feed horse and then lock them up with no
    exercise, he needs exercise to build muscle
    and grow slowly, if you just make him fat
    with no exercise, he will have bone and other
    issues when he can't carry his weight.
    Alfalfa is known to be good for putting on
    weight, so the mix will be fine, the runny
    poop is probably from all the grain and
    weight gain, and other crap, back on that,
    grass hay is what horse eat and do best on,
    stick with that and he will be fine. Yes some
    alfalfa can cause the runs, but that is when
    it is too rich, normally first or second
    cutting and if the horse is only being fed
    alfalfa. I know you mean well, but you got
    the horse from his neglected home and he is
    getting good food, let it go slow and in six
    months of just having food, you will see big
    change, but exercise is needed too, that will
    make him want to eat and will build muscle
    and well help him heal emotionally.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Holy Crap, I don't have enough time or space
    to give you the cons. If you are getting it
    as a pet to just feed and brush, not a big
    deal, if you plan on starting it under saddle
    and riding it, the short list is you can get
    killed or hurt, you screw up the young horse
    so bad you can't sell it or give it away, you
    get hurt and get out of horses all together,
    you can't ride for at least four years and
    then for the 3 years it is still in training,
    you never can relax and enjoy riding with a
    young horse, it is such a bad idea. Green
    owners should NOT own green horses...Green on
    green = black and blue. I tell people this
    all the time and they don't listen and I have
    yet to have one person I told this that did
    not agree with a year later, but then it is
    too late and you own a spoiled,
    uncontrollable horse that no one wants and
    you end up either getting out of horses from
    frustration or get out from getting hurt and
    you can longer ride. Read my horsemanship and
    bad horsemanship page for more examples.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First I would say get rid of the chain, no
    horse needs a stud chain, it hurts, it does
    not create trust, it does create fear and
    pain, I agree you do need a refresher, horses
    do not respond to fear and pain, they get
    more fearful and learn not to trust the one
    that hurts them. You said the horse does not
    have the skills to realize you walk around
    people and not over them, I say it all the
    when you blame your horse, you describe
    yourself. I think you do not the skills to
    teach him how to not be fearful of you, no
    skills to teach him to trust you, and no
    skills to communicate with him unless you use
    a chain to hurt him. I try and be the voice
    of the horse. You horse is trying to tell you
    this and you are not understanding this. If
    you give him better direction you will not
    have to call him names like he has no skills.
    Your horse is only a horse and that is all he
    knows. Any bad habits he has came from
    people, any bad habits he keeps comes from
    you, any new bad habits he gets comes from
    you and anything he learn good comes from
    you. Don't blame your horse, look to yourself
    for the answers. Fix yourself and your horse
    will get better.All horses can be fixed after
    people have screwed them up, it will just
    take horse time. Horse time is as long it
    takes a horse to get it. Some take longer,
    some take shorter, but they all get it if it
    is done right. I am not a bit person, so I
    would try and to a bosal and get rid of the
    mech hack. However, not sure you can show in
    that. She has to learn that the bit will not
    hurt her or cause pain. So I would get a
    snaffle and one piece leather head stall
    (hanger) and let the wear the bit, no reins,
    no pulling, just let her learn to carry the
    bit. After a few days of this, then do some
    attach small light reins, maybe even sting,
    then let her carry it and just use the sting
    lightly to show her she can get pressure on
    the bit without it hurting. After a while of
    that, you use reins, make sure you can flex
    her and she knows how to give to pressure
    from the ground before you try and use the
    bit in the saddle.

    Question: Hi I have a year old colt which has
    briefly been handled - he comes up to me in
    his own time and licks my hand - i can then
    gently stroke is neck and then move to his
    shoulder. He then sometimes walks off and
    then comes back again for some more. My
    difficulty is that i cannot get a head collar
    on him - if he sees the head collar he is off
    and wont even come near me. If i do managed
    to get it near him and stroke him with it he
    will then walk off. If i tried to do it up
    around his neck he just darts off. Any
    suggestions please. Answer: Horses know what
    is going to happen before it happens, so you
    are changing your body and behavior and maybe
    sneaking or trying to be too easy and too
    careful, this tells the horse you are up to
    something and makes them want to flee. Carry
    a collar with you and DON'T try and catch
    him, just do your the same thing you do when
    you don't have the collar, no matter how much
    you think you can catch him don't, just carry
    the collar, rub him with it and let him get
    use to you having it and not being caught,
    after a few successes then try and feed him
    in a small pen or stall or small fenced in
    area so he cannot run away too easy and then
    try and put the collar on. Every time he runs
    off from you, he tells you you are lower, he
    is higher, you can't stop him, he is in
    charge, he is smarter than you and he should
    not trust you. All bad lessons, it is better
    if you walk away first, you leave him, make
    him want to follow you, make him think you
    are higher, you leave first and you are
    smarter. The slow way is the fast way, so
    just hang out with him, spend lots of time
    just hanging out, not petting chasing or any
    pressure things, just handing and being part
    of his herd, trust will follow and things
    will get easier. All horses are dangerous if
    pushed too fast, if handled wrong, if abused,
    if cornered or if put into a situation where
    they think their life is in danger. If the
    only advice you "trainer" can give you is he
    is dangerous, then that trainer is just as
    dangerous for calling himself a trainer.
    First you terminology bugs me, good horsemen
    or horsewomen do not "break" horses, this
    implies rough handling, breaking the spirit
    and forcing a horse with fear, pain and
    intimidation. Good natural horseman "start"
    horses, by using natural instincts of a horse
    to help a horse learn and deal with their
    fear, using time, patience and understanding.
    I know it is just a word, but wanted to make
    sure you knew what I meant when I used the
    word "start" This horse is telling you
    something, you have figure out what. You have
    to be a horse and try and see this from a
    horse's point of view. Why he is doing this,
    what is causing this (you?), how can you help
    the horse understand what you want, how can
    you work with him to get him to work with you
    and deal with his fear. I do not think this
    horse is doing this just to get out of work,
    that is what humans would do. A horse accepts
    his life when he understands he has no other
    options and he is not in danger. This sounds
    like a combo of issues but the two that
    scream out to me is lack of respect and
    improper starting (foundation, training from
    this trainer) and previous mishandling. The
    fact that you got on this horse and rode him
    does not impress me and I think you are
    gambling with luck. Each time he runs off,
    stops you from mounting, pushes you away or
    gets away from you, he thinks he is smarter,
    he is higher and you are weak, not a good
    leader and he should not trust you. This is
    key to getting a horse to respond to your
    request. You have to change what you are
    doing so the horse will change what it is
    doing. If you keep doing the same thing, the
    horse will keep doing the same thing. This
    horse does not trust you or respect you, that
    is the bottom line, fix that and most all
    other problems will go away. You are taking
    the easy way if you continue to allow this
    and then ride him and think he is safe, trust
    you or respects you, then you are making a
    bad decision and setting yourself and this
    horse up for failure. Deal with this respect
    and trust issue on the ground and go back to
    riding, if you take the time it takes, it
    will take less time. The slow way is the fast
    way with horses. Read my horsemanship page on
    my web site, really understand herd behavior
    and sacking out, if you do this you will grow
    and help this horse, if you decide to rush it
    and not put in the time, then you cheat
    yourself and the horse. good luck,
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most of my advice deals with what we do as
    riders that cause the problems. Since you are
    the only one handling this horse, you have
    taught him to do what he does. Soft hands
    make soft horses, a horse will not pull
    against nothing??? So first work on your
    hands, really learn and practice holding and
    NOT pulling and giving back as soon as the
    horse gives. Do some riding with a rope
    halter and ONE rein riding, this teaches you
    to use one rein independently, to control the
    softly since you cannot cheat and use two
    reins, then after a few rides with just one
    rein, you will learn how to pay attention and
    really concentrate on one hand, one rein, one
    cue, and one answer. This also teaches you
    how to communicate with your horse since you
    have to be easy, since you only have one
    rein.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The problem is in the paddock and in the
    stall. We moved him to a new barn a few
    months ago, and he became uncontrollably
    psychotic. When he wasn't
    bucking&amp;bolting, he was very nervous
    about being away from other horses. The barn
    is set up so that he only consistently sees 2
    other horses and occasionally sees 7 others,
    but has no interaction with them. He has
    gotten better about the paddock, but the
    owner of the barn tells me that he is still
    pacing back and forth, even when there is hay
    in the paddock. She cut the paddock in half
    to try to get him to stop, but he needs the
    bigger paddock because of arthritic stifles.
    I haven't seen him pace much as of late. When
    i or my mom is there, he is quiet. He is
    still bad in the barn for me when all the
    other horses are outside. He is also bad if
    the two other horses are being worked at the
    same time and he can't see them. I'm at my
    whit's end and i have no idea what to do. The
    barn owner told us that me that we should
    start looking at a new place for him as he is
    "very unhappy there." This is true but we are
    unable to move to another barn at this time.
    Please help!
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ANSWER: The worst thing you can do is make
    his paddock smaller, he needs horses to feel
    safe, you are abusing this horse by keeping
    him locked up in a small area. If you cannot
    provide better care then you should not have
    him. Find him a pasture with other horses
    even if means you can't see him as often or
    as much, you are killing this horse mentally
    and his behavior will only get worse and then
    he will end up hurting you when you ride him
    and then he will get blamed for being a bad
    horse.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Horses are made to be locked up alone, it is
    the worst thing for a horse. I discuss this
    on my Bad Horsemanship page of my website.
    Don't be selfish and keep this horse so you
    have a horse, you will end up getting hurt by
    this poor horse that is going crazy since he
    is being caged and jailed.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: Well you are very detailed in your
    information and I wonder if you are the same
    way with your horse. Too much information may
    over load this horse. Try and do less, with
    horses less is more. Try and ride this horse
    nice and slow NOT in arena or jumps, just
    have a nice calm ride with him, get to know
    him as a horse and let him get to know you
    without all the yields, leg pressure, bit
    controls, commands, lead, hip in and out,
    hindquarter control, transitions, jumps,
    trots, canters, diagonals, etc.... Just be
    his friend and see what he tells you when you
    just hang out with him. It sounds like he is
    trying to tell lots, but maybe you are not
    able to him since you are so focused on all
    the specifics and riding rules.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question: I am a forty year old female with a
    12 year old gelding. He was given as a gift.
    He is fine with my husband as the herd leader
    but not so with me. When feeding in the field
    he has run around me, blocked me and turned
    his but to me. I am fearful of what he might
    do next. I tried to lunge him - worked for
    that day only. I thought the bag idea was a
    really good for the young ones but don't want
    to cause spookiness in this older one.
    Help!!! Answer: Don't worry about spooky,
    teach this horse not to mess with you, he is
    testing you and if you do not respond with
    making him move he will see you as weak, a
    lower horse and his behavior will get worse.
    Any act of disrespect from him to you should
    be dealt with hard and seriously, so he will
    respect and will know the right answer is not
    to mess with people, I don't think you will
    make him spooky and even if you do, at least
    you will be safe.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: I agree, Ray would not agree with
    that. You said you want the horse back that
    you had, which implies he was good when you
    got him and now he is not, which means you
    make him the way he is. If he was already
    this way when you got him, then whatever you
    have done has not worked and you have failed
    to help him, so either way you need to change
    what you are doing if you want your horse to
    change. Most catching problems are from bad
    catches, people problems. I catch my horses
    some time to just them a carrot, some time
    just to walk them to fresh grass to let them
    eat, some time to bring them in for grain,
    some time to just groom them, and some time
    to ride them.... so they never know what will
    happen when I catch them, but they do know
    that it will not always be bad or work.....
    So I have kept the curiosity alive the horse.
    Too many people only catch a horse to lock
    them in a stall, to saddle them up, to take
    them to a round pen, to pull them away from
    their herd, to work them, to show them who is
    boss, etc... I am surprised on how many
    horses allow them self to be caught... Change
    what you are doing and your horse will
    change, hang out with your horse without
    trying to catch him, spend time with your
    horse being a good pasture mate, make it
    worth something to the horse so he will want
    to be with you rather than worry when he see
    you... The horse is never wrong and it is
    never the horse's fault.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: lol, not sure what I said, but you
    are right, I do not listen to people as well
    as horses. However, each of your emails tend
    to be about YOU telling me what I should be
    listening too, what I should be seeing and
    what I should be telling you. This is email,
    and since 75% or more of communication is
    NON-Verbal, you are only getting maybe 25% of
    my message. So words and ideas tend to get
    lost or blurred. So perhaps, you could maybe
    take what you can from my answer, even thou
    it is not perfect, like you and your horse,
    and maybe accept what little help you get and
    be happy with small victories, then maybe you
    would grow to listen to your horse and hear
    more than what you want, what you think or
    what other tell you. My answers are the best
    I can from a short email on complex subject
    hearing only YOUR side!!! I do not get to
    talk or see the horse's view, I do not get to
    see you and get your non verbals and you do
    not get to see mine. So another observation I
    get from your email is, you want more, you
    want perfection, you want it your way and
    cannot accept small help, small tries and
    small victories. If I helped your horse just
    a little bit, I really don't care if I helped
    you, make you feel valued, made you feel
    special, or whatever else you are looking
    for. I DO THIS TO HELP HORSES! So, if you
    FEEL better telling me how I don't listen,
    how I did not help, how I did not
    whatever................ Sleep on this, YOU
    asked me, I do this for free, I don't ask for
    anything in return and 75% of the people I
    try and help, blame me or their horse so I
    have become very uncaring about what people
    say, since I know, I do this for the horse
    not for people. It is never the horse's
    fault, the horse is never wrong, and people
    cause most all problems with horses! A good
    horseman can hear a horse talk, a great
    horseman can hear a horse whisper and a bad
    horseman will not hear a horse even if it
    screams.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: Well, a lot of errors on your part.
    Most are common rookie mistakes, but like I
    always say, a horse has to pay for our
    mistakes and have no choice in the matter.
    The hot wire is dumb, hot should not be on
    gate or where horses walk through a lot,
    every time a horse get hit with hot wire and
    you are holding or leading or with the horse,
    the horse thinks you did it, does not know
    why and it destroys trust and makes a horse
    not want to be with you.... I agree with the
    horse, if I got shocked for no reason when
    you were around, I would not want to be
    around you. Horse know how to run and protect
    them self if we humans stay out of it. So you
    need to pay more attention and be more aware.
    You suckered your horse into an area with
    another horse and then cornered him (held on
    to lead rope) and prevented him from running
    or protecting himself. A whip may help for a
    while, but you need to make sure EVERY horse
    knows you are high horse and don't mess with
    you don't approach you and don't come near
    you unless you invite them in. And the time
    to teach this is not when your poor horse is
    stuck in the middle or forced to be there. As
    for when you said the herd or horses make you
    chase, that is absolutely bullcrap a horse
    does not make you chase them you choose to
    chase them and you do it, Since you do not
    know what else to do, since you decide to
    chase, since you failed to learn how to be
    part of a herd and how to enter a herd as
    leader, you force the horses to run. This is
    another rookie move and only inexperienced
    horse people do this, since they fail to grow
    and learn better more effective ways of
    dealing and communicating with horses. Work
    on your self and your horse horse will get
    better. Listen to others who do not know and
    you will continue to repeat their mistakes.
    Learn for yourself, read, study the horse,
    spend time hanging out and being with horses,
    listen to horses and stop always trying to
    teach them and show them, learn from them,
    they are the best teacher of the horse.
    Knowledge of the horse is the best gift you
    can give to a horse.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question: Now, per your advice, I'm regularly
    ponying both problem mares and they love it!
    The first time I ponied the bucking mare, she
    pulled her lead out of my hands. She galloped
    all over with the lead slamming her rear
    until she figured out to gallop back to my
    old gelding and me and beg forgiveness. She
    never tried it again. Now she makes those
    happy blowing sounds as we ride and keeps the
    lead loose even though I insist on keeping
    her nose within 3 feet of my knee. As for the
    Paso Fino mare, today I took her on her first
    serious bush whacking expedition, to a peak
    of Monte Largo. I'd call it just a steep hill
    with sliding rocks and cactus and junipers,
    but back East people might call it a
    mountain. She was worried at first when we
    turned to go down as she had to just about
    sit on her rump it was so steep, but after
    just two or three minutes she gathered up her
    courage. I'm also trying out longing the
    bucking mare the donkey training way, walking
    with her in small circles as she circles just
    eight feet away from me, and then doing the
    pivot on hind feet, then pivot on front feet
    the way you do it with donkeys. Interestingly
    enough, she has been making those happy
    blowing sounds when we do these exercises,
    which she never did before with Parelli-style
    "games". Answer: Thanks for kind words. Being
    right is not my goal, helping horses get a
    better deal is why I do this. I really did
    nothing, I tell people all the time, it is
    never the horse's fault. So if it is always
    our fault then when a horse does good, it is
    because we did good, we listened, we set the
    horse up for success, we gave good directions
    and helped the horse find the right answer.
    You changed what you were doing so the horse
    changed. Glad to hear your are enjoying your
    horses more and it seems your horses are
    enjoying you more. Don't forget the lesson,
    horses are just a reflection of us and what
    we do. Happy trails,
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ANSWER: First I would stop caring or worrying
    about what she does in pasture, who cares if
    she plays runs, gets exercise, spooks, you
    said she was under weight and now getting
    good hay, beet pulp and other good food, now
    she has energy she never had before since she
    was starving, now she is learning how to use
    her feet, body, turn and play and be a horse.
    This barn manager that wants to pull her out
    of field is an idiot, if a horse in a field
    is bothering someone getting a lesson, then
    the instructor and person getting the lesson
    needs to worry about what they are doing and
    now what a horse in pasture is doing. That is
    just a bunch of crazy horse women who want to
    try and control the world instead of
    controlling their horse. I also think you are
    reacting too much to this horse and it is
    causing confusion. Ignore anything the horse
    does and stay focused on what you want, no
    matter what she does, do not react, do not
    try and stop it, do not try and correct it,
    just stay focused on what you want. This
    horse is could have eye sight issues and if
    she is losing her sight, that is very scary
    for a horse. It could be that she knows
    everyone around her gives her attention and
    stops trying to make her work when she
    spooks, so she could be training you and
    others that she is crazy so she does not have
    to work. When I say give direction, I mean
    stop reacting to her, just keep showing what
    you want, stay focused on the task, don't let
    her distract you or get you to stop or change
    what you are doing. By not reacting to her,
    you show her you are smart, you are strong
    and a good leader. 1: All horses drop gran,
    in the wild they do not get grain, they chew,
    grass, long and they even drop grass some
    time, so dropping grain is not that rare, in
    fact,very normal. Feed him in a bucket, if it
    drop he can still pick up and eat again.
    Horses kept in pasture and graze have better
    teeth then horses stalled and fed grain and
    hay. A horse does not need to be put down to
    float teeth, many years ago, it was very rare
    for a horse to get meds to get teeth floated,
    if the horse is sacked out and handled
    enough, not need for meds. 2: This horse is
    old and may have immunities or may be old and
    have a lower defense, personal choice, if it
    aint hurting him, I would get them but spread
    them out every two or three months and don't
    shock and over power the system with all of
    them at once. 3: Coughing is a Vet questions,
    your horse is old, in the wild not to many
    horses make it past 10 or 12, not worming, no
    vit, no grain, no feet care, no fresh water
    in winter, colic, no teeth work, no shots, so
    we have made it to where we keep horses alive
    longer, but they legs, muscles, joints, body
    starts deteriorating, so riding a horse in
    later years is very very hard on a horse. You
    like it and feel safe, but it can be really
    hard on an older horse. If this horse has
    given you many years of good rides, lesson
    and love, you may want to get another horse
    (not a young 3 year old) so you and this
    horse can still go out, maybe pony and let
    the horse get exercise walking with you and
    not being ridden. I see and hear people
    riding horses 28 and 30, I just think this is
    not good for a horse.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: Its sounds like you rode her too much
    and too hard too fast. You said she had not
    been ridden and then you said I rode her
    alot. It would be like you sitting on the
    couch all winter and then I drag you out and
    make you 20 miles, you would sore, hurting,
    not happy and may sit down yourself. What you
    did is a good way to get a horse sour to
    riding, sour to being with you, sour to
    getting saddled, makes them sore so when you
    ride them the next day she will buck from
    pain and soreness. Treat a horse the way you
    would want to be treated. The slow way is the
    fast way with horses. I would give her a week
    or so off and then SLOWLY get her back in
    shape, take short easy rides. It may have
    only been a test, but since you did what you
    did there is no way of knowing. It could also
    be a back injury, it would a pulled muscle or
    tendon that was aggravated from a lot of
    riding. Approach things from a horse's point
    of view. It is not fun him either. You are
    looking at this as a horse problem. I see
    this as a YOU problem. I see this as you are
    not giving clear cues, the horse is confuse,
    the horse is not ready, you have not taught
    the horse what you want, you have prepared
    the horse so he knows what you want, you are
    going too fast, you are asking what the horse
    cannot give yet, you are pushing too hard or
    not pushing hard enough...... as you see, I
    think most all horse problems are people
    problems. I think this since if a trainer, or
    experience horseman or someone can get on a
    horse and make the horse better and do things
    that another can't, then it always tells me
    that the horse can do anything if it is asked
    right, taught right and showed right. A horse
    knows how to be a horse, too many people try
    to fix a horse, try to make a horse better,
    try to teach a horse..... if people listened
    to a horse and learned from a horse, then
    there would be less horse problems. No matter
    what you are doing, it is either not working,
    the horse is confused, or the horse does not
    know what you want or what the right answer
    is. It always comes back to you or me or
    anyone. Until you see this as a you problem,
    YOU can't fix it. Try going back to basic,
    get your horse to stop and go when you tell
    him, forget where he goes.... once you get
    him good at stopping and moving when you tell
    him, then work on moving and changing
    directions, left and right, stop and starts,
    then when he gets good at that, then have him
    go to one point and stop. Then go to another
    point and stop. If you take a few weeks and
    some time, you will get better with your cues
    and he will get better understanding what you
    want. It is a partnership, not a horse that
    you have to constantly correct...???
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: Well from your question you sound
    like you think a bit stops a horse and you
    say the horse runs or walks thru it. This
    tells me you are pulling on the bit to try
    and stop the horse, this will not work and
    will only teach the horse pull, which is what
    your horse is doing. Never ever pull on two
    reins when stopping a horse, only one rein,
    your goal is to get the horse to circle and
    bend his head one way, that will slow him,
    make him uncomfortable and he will want to
    stop, you are trying to use the bit, pain
    from the bit to make him stop, that will not
    work. Read my horsemanship page so you can
    understand how horses think. As for bits, I
    don't use any bit and believe that if you
    cannot stop a horse in a halter, then you
    should not be riding them. A snaffle bit is a
    NON leverage bit, when you pull one pound the
    horse feels one pound this is better for the
    horse, helps you develop feel. A curb bit is
    a Leverage bit, it give 3 to 5 pounds of
    pressure for every one pound you pull, it is
    more painful, it can hurt more with less
    pull. A curb bit is for a horse that is neck
    reined and is softer. A snaffle is a training
    bit that is more forgiving of hard or
    inexperienced hands. You are blaming the
    horse and the bit for the horse not stopping
    or running through a bit..... I say YOU are
    the reason this is happening. I assure you I
    could ride this horse in a halter and this
    horse would stop within 10 to 20 mins. I
    would say ride this horse in a halter in a
    round pen or small enclosed area so he cannot
    run off, teach him to stop with body cues and
    not from pain of a bit, then you will not
    need a bit to stop him and your confidence
    will grow and so will the horse.

    Question: I have been working with my stud
    and his ground manners are very good. But
    when it comes to the saddle pad and the
    saddle he freaks out. What can I do to make
    this an easier experience for the both of us.
    Answer: When you say he freaks out that tells
    me you have not prepared him properly. You
    need to work on sacking out, that will build
    trust and teach you to read him and teach him
    that you can put pressure and remove
    pressure. Read my horsemanship page and it
    will help you understand why your horse does
    it does.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    QUESTION: We have a herd of 3 mares and 3
    geldings. The last horse on the place is my
    14 yr. old Buckskin gelding. At first he
    seemed fine at the bottom of the pecking
    order but once the alpha mare went onto heat,
    he started acting differently. Out of the
    blue he attacked my 20 yr. old paint gelding.
    He kept biting him and ran him through an
    electric fence. My paint ended up in the
    middle of a 2 lane highway and thank God he
    wasn't hit. Now I have to keep my paint in a
    box stall or the outdoor arena or the
    Buckskin attacks him. The alpha mare isn't
    doing much to protect the paint but she kind
    of tries to "boss" the Buckskin around. Can I
    ever put the two geldings out together again?
    I am concerned for the paint because he is 20
    and I don't want him bullied or badly hurt.
    What should I do? ANSWER: I say stop trying
    to protect horses from horse, this is the
    natural order, the older gelding is getting
    slower and weaker, so instincts tell the
    other horses they have to move. The 20 yr old
    tries to hang on and has to make sure the 14
    yr old is ready. Once the 20 yr old accepts
    this they will stop fighting, you are trying
    to prevent something and all you are doing is
    making it worse and prolonging it. You do not
    have to keep the horse in a box stall you
    think you have to. This is nothing but horses
    being horses, if the fence was not there,
    like in the wild, the horse would have worked
    this out and all would be fine, since the
    fence was there and since you locked the
    horse up, you think you helped and I think
    you made it worse. Put the two in a round pen
    with no corners and no fence and they will
    run, kick, bite and rear and will work it out
    and the winner will be higher and the loser
    will be lower.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: When something is not working stop
    and look at what you are doing. If the horse
    is playing with the halter, then it is not
    scared of it, so that tells me that you are
    trying too hard and not the right way. You
    have to get the horse used to you rubbing and
    being around his face before you move to
    trying to put something on his face. So lots
    of rubs, scratches, give carrots with one
    hand while the other hand is rubbing ears and
    eyes, very short rubs and touches with lots
    of RELEASE. You have to stop doing something
    before the horse moves or makes you stop,
    then slowly do it longer and longer so the
    horse learns to expect it, after you do this
    a while then add just a rope, do not catch or
    try and hold, just rub the rope around the
    head, ears and eyes, mouth etc... then after
    lots of that then maybe put the rope around
    his nose and around his head, then take off
    (release) after the horse tells you he is
    good with those little steps, then rub the
    halter around and let him get used to that,
    don't try and put it on, just let him learn
    that it will not hurt him, then when the
    horse tells you he is ready, you can put it
    on...once you get it one don't try and drag
    him around and pull him or go too fast.. this
    horse needs lots of time to learn and figure
    out he is safe with you and with things you
    put on him.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: Like most horse problems, people
    normally cause them. When you get better your
    horse gets better. The horse is seven and you
    got him at two, that means he has had almost
    5 years to figure you out. Horses know what
    is going to happen before it happens. This
    horse knows you and feels safe with you but
    does not see you a strong leader or he would
    not do the things he is doing. You need to
    look at this as your problem, don't try and
    fix the horse, improve yourself, learn and
    work on what you are doing wrong, fix that
    and the horse issues will go away. This may
    sound strange, but I assure it, I have seen a
    thousand times. The sooner people fix them
    self, their horse gets better. You need to
    work on your communication, you leadership
    role, your higher position, work on
    understand and listening to this horse,
    understand why he is doing what he doing and
    how you are contributing to what he is doing,
    once you find that then you can change what
    you are doing and your horse will change. If
    you do the same thing, you horse will do the
    same thing. People always want their horse to
    change but they are not will to accept their
    part and change to make it better and easier
    for the horse. Read my horsemanship and it
    will help you see horses different. I put my
    site together so people that wanted to read
    and take the time to learn and improve their
    knowledge, they could do it for free. So read
    my entire site and you will learn things you
    never knew about horses and you will them
    different, then you will change how you deal
    with them and you will see as your grow your
    horse gets better.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer: I am a big anti Tom Thumb bit, here
    is a link to a good article on that bit the
    explains how bad it is.
    http://www.markrashid.com/trouble_with_tom_thumb.htm
    The bit is not the issue, you, your hands and
    ability is the issue. Since you have been
    riding in a TT, you have been relying on the
    pain and pressure of the bit so you have not
    been concentrating on your hands, you
    softness, your horse's responses, so you have
    trained yourself to be hard hands,
    unconsciously, and you have trained your
    horse to ignore you, not pay attention to you
    and to only listen if you are rough, cause
    pain and hurt him. Bad lessons all around. So
    a snaffle or hackamore is a direct rein
    device, so you will have less strength, less
    pain and less control AT FIRST. But this will
    force you to work with your horse, pay
    attention to your horse and have better
    communication with your horse. People that
    use TT tend to be poor horsepeople since they
    have relied on this pain device, so they
    normally lack confidence and the ability to
    control and ride a horse without the cheat of
    a pain device. So you will have to commit to
    learn and change your old ways of riding and
    learn and grow and work with your horse as a
    partner and not as you being a ruler. The
    fact is you should not be riding any horse
    with any bit unless you can ride them in a
    halter. Read my site, on my horsemanship page
    on riding with one rein and learning to ride
    with just a halter, this will make you better
    able to change and feel like you have
    control, so start in a round pen or small
    enclosed area so you can learn to talk to
    your horse without pain. Soft hands make soft
    horses; hard hands make hard horses
    absolutely think this is an handling issue
    and human issue. If this person does not like
    QH and your horse is a QH, I would say that
    is your answer. Anyone that claims to be a
    trainer or expert and then groups horses into
    breeds is an idiot in my book. A horse is a
    horse, period. Some breeds have different
    pros and cons, but they are all horses, they
    are all prey animals and they are all fear
    based and have strong survival instincts. I
    can make a horse head shy in about two
    minutes, if I hit the horse in the face, hit
    with a rope in the face, punch it or do
    anything painful to the face, the horse will
    learn fast and will move his head anytime
    something moves to his face. You can test
    this. Give your horse a treat, if it takes it
    without shying then give this "expert
    trainer" a treat and ask him to give it to
    your horse, the horse will tell you if he is
    the one making him head shy. Food is a blamed
    for many of horse problems, it can have some
    influence but rarely enough to create
    dramatic changes. Rolled oats are fine for a
    horse and they have been eating them for
    years, I feed my horse oats. It may give more
    energy, it may make them feel stronger, it
    may increase their alertness, but so will
    just about anything you feed a horse. We feed
    good grown, good fertilized and high quality
    hay, then we grain them with high energy
    grain, then we give vitamin supplements,
    maybe some corn oil, beet pulp, rice bran,
    corn sweet feed, sugar treats, alfalfa hay
    and then lock a horse up in a stall and
    wonder why they get excited when we handle
    them. Like most horse problems they are
    really people problems. Moderation is the
    key, not too much of any one thing. More
    exercise and turn out time, more ride time,
    more handling time will make better horses.
    You can make a horse listen no matter what he
    eats if the horse sees you as his leader and
    you understand horses. So anyone that starts
    trying to address horse issues with food,
    stalls, equipment, surroundings, just don't
    get it. I am in California so not too to
    Ohio, sorry. This can be fixed easy with
    proper handling and keeping Yahoo's away from
    your horse. Don't try and address this head
    shy problem and try and fix it. Just be
    normal and lots of rubs to head and face so
    the horse will learn to enjoy it and will not
    associate it with slaps, yanks or hits. This
    is based on the facts you provided. If you
    see a head shy problem as a head shy problem
    and it really is a disrespect issue and the
    horse is just showing you that you are not
    the boss and that she is not going to let you
    touch her head, then this is a different
    issue.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All horses are a dream until you ask them to
    do something or put pressure on them. Forget
    what happen as a colt, it is not important.
    Keeping him in a paddock and locked up is the
    biggest problem. A horse needs other horses
    to feel safe, to learn, to play, to get
    scared, to be able to run and play,
    especially Geldings. As for him running off
    when you get on, you should not be getting on
    until you are sure he wont run off. Small
    steps, a little at a time, hobble train him
    and teach him to tie well with a ROPE HALTER.
    Do your first mounts when tied and then when
    hobbled in an enclosed area, so if he runs
    off he can only go in a circle. You should
    not get on until you are sure he will not run
    off. So just put a foot in and get off, put
    weight on stirrup and get off, stand in
    stirrup and get off, lean over saddle and get
    off, put a leg over and get off immediately.
    You have to show him that he is not trapped
    when you get on teach him that you get off
    every time you get on, so he learns the right
    response is to stand still. Yes, absolutely
    put him with the other horses all the time.
    They will teach him more in a day than you
    can in a year. He needs to learn manners,
    respect, move from pressure, pecking order
    and many other things. He is going crazy from
    being alone. He will get meaner and more
    uncontrollable the more you keep him alone.
    Let them do the hard lesson so you will not
    have to. He will still bite you and
    disrespect you if you do not show him you are
    higher, but the other horses will make it
    clear how he treats higher horses, which will
    be you when you two are together. First a
    light tom thumb is like saying I saw a light
    elephant. The TT bit is one of the worst pain
    producing bits out there. Many people think
    it is a snaffle and it is not. It is a
    leverage bit with a break in the mouth piece,
    but most people think since it has a break
    that it is a snaffle. If I could get rid of
    the worst bits the TT would be one of them. A
    twisted wire snaffle is a snaffle but one of
    the worst snaffles for pain. It causes it
    pain. I don't blame this horse for running,
    he wants the rider off and wants the pain to
    stop. So it makes perfect sense what he is
    doing. I always tell people that if you can't
    ride your horse in a halter, then you should
    not be riding it in a bit. A halter ensures
    you know how to control the horse without
    pain, it makes you learn to communicate with
    the horse verses make him do things with
    pain. I don't use bits, don't promote them
    and whenever I work with a horse the first
    thing that goes is the bit and then I get to
    the other issues, which normally immediately
    become less as the bit goes away. Now I know
    that any bit can be soft or hard, depending
    on who is hold the reins, so the other rider
    you talk of may be scared or nervous of the
    horse, so her fear causes her to hang on and
    pull the bit harder thinking that is how she
    can control him, this is a mistake of many
    riders, new and old. A bit does not control a
    horse, never did and never will, a horse will
    run with a broken jaw and bloody lips and
    will ignore pain if they think their life is
    in danger. Pain = fear = reaction = run that
    is the way of the horse.

    I am 46 years old, and have very little horse
    experience. I haven't done anything to fix
    problem, but try to scold the older horse.
    Both horses are male and in a pasture with a
    barn.I have a 20 ish year old Tennessee
    Walker, have had him 4 or so months. I put in
    a 2 year old quarter horse. The Tn Walker
    bites and runs the quarter horse, especially
    while I am there feeding them, ( in different
    troughs ). The quarter ran through a barbed
    wire fence that was near a pond and cut up
    his face area. His eyes are ok, no major cuts
    or damage. Should I not worry or think of
    separating them? ANSWER: How long have they
    been together? How big is the area? Feed in
    the middle of the pasture with different
    piles, at least three and at least 20 feet
    apart. This is normal herd behavior, the
    older one is teaching the young one manners.
    Don't separate them, in a few days or a week
    they will be buddies. Read my horsemanship
    page, it will help you understand what is
    going on. You need to educate your self about
    horses more so you will understand what and
    why they do what they do. This totally
    normal. Rick ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------
    QUESTION: They have only been together for 4
    or 5 days. They are in a several acre
    pasture. Why 3 piles and not just 2 piles?
    Answer: lol, see there you go wanting a quick
    answer and a fast fix, I explain this in
    detail on my site. If you understood horses
    you would know this. Food is competition, the
    lead horse gets to eat first, gets to eat the
    best food, gets to drink first, this is how
    horses live, if you understood this you would
    know how to prevent problems and then would
    not have to ask others how to fix problems.
    Prevention is better than treatment,
    direction is better than correction, knowing
    is better than asking. Well for 16 you show
    more character than a lot of adults. You need
    to be honest and let the buyer know what you
    think, if they make a choice to buy the horse
    then they accept that this, like any horse,
    may or not be prefect and will make mistakes.
    Tell people what her good points are, what
    her problems are and let them make the
    decision. You are not forcing anyone to buy
    the horse, so as long as you are honest,
    don't worry about what the horse does after
    you sell it. Now for the making money part,
    this gets my goat, a horse that is a loyal
    friend and companion, as given you years of
    enjoyment, pleasure and many good rides, for
    you to worry about money is offense to me. If
    I got rid of my horse, I would much rather
    give him away to a good home where I know he
    would not be abused or neglect then sell him
    for $10,000 to someone that did not care
    about him. Selling a horse should not be
    about money, it should be about finding a
    home for an animal that you own and have
    accepted responsibility for many years ago,
    just because you sell a horse does not mean
    you are released of the responsibility for
    the good safe care of the horse. It would be
    like if the slaughter house gave me the best
    price for my horse I should sell it to
    them.... that is not being a good
    horseperson. Find your horse a good home and
    even if you take a loss, you owe it to your
    friend who have given you much over the
    years. That is my take,
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    First, your dream means nothing to the horse.
    Your horse wants understanding. You need to
    understand horses better. Just from what you
    told me your story has been told a 1000
    times. Your horse should not be showing any
    teeth, this is a severe show of lack of
    respect, you need to do ground work, round
    penning and teach this horse that you are the
    leader, head horse and she must not treat you
    like a lower horse. You have not defined the
    pecking order she has. Not good. Don't ride
    her anymore, you are teaching her to throw
    you, every time she does it she finds and
    thinks that is the right answer and that is
    how she gets release. Read my web site, every
    page, you start to see horses different and
    it will help get you in a better starting
    point. All young horses bite or nip, they are
    just testing to see if it ok, don't lecture
    him, just bop, swap, smack on the mouth the
    second he does it, you can let him nuzzle,
    and rub and explore with his nose, but the
    second he puts teeth, whack him and move on
    forget it, don't carry on and make a bid deal
    about it, the correction should never be
    longer than the act. As for the other horses,
    I would put him in with them immediately, if
    may make it harder for you to catch or get
    close, but it will be better for him. He will
    feel safer and will have a herd to protect
    him, then the more time you spend with your
    other two, he will see this and will want to
    hang out with you since you hang out with his
    herd. Keeping him apart is only raising his
    insecurity and is confusing him. A lone horse
    is the worst thing for a horse........ I
    know, I know, but Rick they can sniff each
    other and visit over the fence, it is not the
    same, it is bad any way you look at it....
    get him with his own kind and his herd ASAP.
    You will a big change in his confidence, his
    sleep, his stress, all good.... yes they may
    bite him or chase at first, let it happen and
    stay out of it, make sure you feed like a
    recommend on my site. Sounds like you are
    wearing her out. She is telling you she is
    scared, she may have had a bad experience
    with ditches or may never have seen one or
    crossed one before. For only 3 trail rides
    and already at 14 miles, you appear to be
    going way too fast. Give this horse a chance
    to learn, teach her, don't scare her or fear
    her over, start with small ditches, get off
    and walk her over them so she can see you
    cross first, try and understand her fear and
    not just put more pressure on her when she is
    scared. If you keep this up she will soon
    stop trusting you and only see you as someone
    that scares her or does not understand her,
    either way you will not have a partnership,
    you will be a forceful master and she will be
    nothing more than a slave.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Q: Hi Rick. My sister is 12 going on her 5th
    year of riding. She recently recieved a
    arab/welsh 10 y.o. pony. he is a very willing
    partner but he is green. He doesnt stop very
    easily when she asks nicely (half halts,
    stops with seat). My mother says that the
    only way that these two will learn together
    is by getting on and just riding. I am afraid
    that she will be to harsh on his mouth, (I
    recently looked in his mouth and found
    minimal gum brusing. So i asume that he has a
    realitively strong mouth.) Do you think that
    my mother is taking the right route with the
    new partnership? (learning by doing?) or
    should she be under consistant professional
    training? Thank you for your time! A: I can't
    help but laugh when I read this. You
    obviously are concerned about your sister.
    However, no matter what I say will change
    anything. You may be right, your concerns
    maybe valid, but your sister and your mother
    appear to have the decision authority here.
    So even if I advise you, what can you do with
    it? Your sister is young and does not know
    much at 12, your mom is right and wrong, you
    mean well and the horse is stuck where it is.
    You say that the horse has gum bruising and
    you assume he has a strong mouth.... I say
    the bit is causing the bruising and your
    sister is too rough, does not know how to be
    soft and should not be riding with a bit. If
    you remove your sister and the bit, I assure
    you the horse would not have gum
    bruising..... so how can anyone come to the
    conclusion that the horse has a strong mouth
    and that is what causes the bruising? All
    horses are strong, but they can only get gum
    bruising from someone pulling the reins and
    bit. So your conclusion tells me you don't
    really understand horses very well, not to
    say you are not trying and you have valid
    concerns, but back to the horse, he is stuck
    where he is. I guess the short answer is,
    your mom is right and wrong and you are right
    and wrong and the horse is just a horse. I
    would put your sister in a round pen with a
    rope halter and lead rope and make her ride
    the horse with only a halter and lead rope
    (NO bit). This will force her to learn to
    communicate with the horse without the
    leverage, pain and bit. By teaching her this,
    you will help her and the horse and your mom
    will be right. The more she rides the better
    she will get and the horse will "teach her".
    This cannot happen with pain, gum bruising
    and bits, it will only happen with time spent
    with the horse without pain. In a round pen
    the horse can't run off and if it does it
    can't go too fast or too far and your sister
    will learn how to stop, slow and control a
    horse without a pain bit and will will gain
    confidence in her riding, seat and
    controlling a horse with communication not
    pain from a bit. This is a win win for
    everyone, you make your sister safer, your
    mom gets your sister on the horse riding, and
    the horse gets rid of a pain bit... I have a
    video on riding with one rein and halter on
    youtube and on my site.<br></p>

    <p class="style3">Kicking:</p>

    <p>Well one thing you can do is tie a ribbon
    to her tail, I think a red ribbon means a
    kicking horse, that way it will warn other
    riders that your horse kicks, don't get too
    close and for those who don't know it, they
    will ask what is the red ribbon for and then
    you tell them. This is not that uncommon of a
    problem. Spurs will not help and will make it
    worse, that is just ignorance. If I was
    teaching you math and gave you question that
    you had no idea of the answer and I kick you
    every time you got it wrong, that is what you
    are doing to a horse with spurs, it does not
    work, don't let anyone spur your horse. Once
    you get to be a better rider you will sense
    the kicks before they happen and will be able
    to pull her in or disengage her rear end, she
    cannot kick if you butt if moving away and
    her head if moving to the gelding. For her
    perspective, she is only of two mares and is
    tired of every male sticking their nose up
    her butt, so she is just defending her honor.
    Keeping her in a stall is contributing to the
    problem, put her in pasture with all the
    geldings, she will get tired of kicking and
    will learn to deal with them in a herd and
    not only when you put a saddle on her and
    make her deal with it. This will make a big
    difference. Well that would depend on what
    you did to get her to start this. It is very
    easy to tell when a horse starts a new
    behavior when the same owner has had the
    horse, then it is easy to see that the owner
    or handler caused it. A horse should not be
    kicking and obviously your hand smack is not
    working, so the horse will not stop. The
    horse is doing this because something caused
    it to start doing it, whatever that was needs
    to be known before you can figure out how to
    fix this, otherwise any fix will only be
    defeated since the same thing will be done
    again to cause this, unless you figure out
    what is causing this.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>ANSWER: If a horse is a herd never hit
    (kicked) another horse and if this horse just
    left when ever another horse kicked at him,
    that horse would be the lowest horse in the
    herd. That horse is you. Praise means
    nothing, leaving means you are weak, not a
    strong leader and you tell the horse you are
    higher, and you can move me or make me leave
    so you are in charge and I will listen to
    you. Very bad lesson for a horse. You should
    treating him like he is treating you. You
    should moving him and making him run or move
    away. Since you can't bite him or kick him,
    you have to hit him, either with a rope or
    your hand. By not smacking him in mouth when
    he bites you, he is telling you he is higher
    and you are lower and by you not doing
    anything you are telling him that you are
    lower and he is higher. Your other horse will
    do the same thing in time if you never
    disciple her. A horse needs a leader and you
    are not being one. You can get rid of him,
    but if you care about him then you need to
    learn how to disciple him and knock the crap
    out of him if he bites you. A bite is a sign
    of lack of respect, then comes kicks, then
    comes rearing and striking out and then comes
    you get hurt and the horse gets put to sleep
    for being dangerous. The horse pays for you
    kindness. It is not fair to the horse. And
    this is normal horse behavior, all horses do
    it and it is the way they are.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>As always my opinion is based only on what
    you tell. The trainer that worked with him
    should be better qualified to give an opinion
    since she has first hand knowledge. Without
    seeing the horse, since I would see things
    different than you, maybe, from your
    description, I have to say you are pushing
    too hard and expecting too much. You said the
    horse make a lot of improvement, that tells
    me you were doing the right things, now you
    say he is regressing and going back, that
    tells me you are not doing the things. The
    horse is the sole judge of what works and
    what does not work. I think horse only get
    sour when people push too hard, too often and
    too much. It sounds like the horse knows that
    the ring is work, no fun, does not want to be
    there and is getting tired of being just
    pushed in the ring. The horse was not this
    way before, according to you, so you had to
    do something to make him this way. You need
    to figure out what you did to create the
    problem and then figure out what to do to fix
    the problem. Your choices seem OK, but I
    can't see the horse and tell what works and
    what does not, only you can do that. I would
    not give up, I would not keep doing what you
    are doing and I would not be more assertive
    if the horse is scared. You can take it easy,
    not work so hard, just spend time with the
    horse as a herd member/leader and just get to
    know the horse without asking something from
    him. You can slow down and do things he is
    good at and go slower on what you want him to
    do. Listen to your horse, he will tell you if
    you listen. Horses are not brats, mean or
    stubborn. Those are human terms that people
    want to put on horses. You questions is
    unclear, you say you have had her for 5
    years, did she do this before, when did it
    start, did you ever ride her in these areas
    before, you said she did not used to be this
    bad, does that mean she has always had the
    problem and got worse. A horse is a
    reflection of the person handling it. Most
    people that blame the horse never look at
    what they are doing to cause the problems.
    She may not want to go up hills since she
    feels your fear or she has not done with you.
    You can try to do ground work in all the
    areas that appear to be a problem with her,
    do things she is good at and knows well,
    build her confidence on the ground in the
    those areas before you try to ride her. The
    fact that you told me, you had to get off,
    tells me that this horse has your number and
    knows how to work you until you get off. As
    for the ear infection, you would know better
    than me it that made it worse or changed
    things. I always look at the person for the
    problem first, since that is normally the
    right answer. Maybe one half percent of all
    horse problems are from something other than
    the person.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: 47 No horse experience I tied
    him up this morning, but when tried to untie
    him he tried to kick, i refused to untie him
    until he stopped, he stopped and then when i
    untied him like to ran me over to get to the
    feed kicking. He is alone right now, he is
    pasture kept. I want to stop this behavior
    and I was told he was just hungry and when he
    gets enough food he will stop this behavior,
    i really don't believe that. I also have a
    gelding in the next pasture that charges the
    fence, ears pinned back and very aggressive
    to the yearling. I want them to get along,
    what do I do to stop this behavior without
    anyone getting hurt. The gelding is 19 years
    old and was pastured alone for several years.
    last year i bought two miniature jennys and
    they are pastured with him. I would like them
    all to be able to roam both pastures
    together. ANSWER: When a lower horse kicks a
    higher horse, the higher horses attacks him
    and makes him run off. Since your horse is
    running you over and kicking at you, he
    thinks you are lower in the pecking order. I
    agree with the horse. You have told him that
    you are lower since you allowed him to treat
    you that way without disciplining him. You
    have little horse experience and your horse
    knows it. Not good for you. You better learn
    fast, since when horses teach lessons to
    humans they are very costly. Read my
    horsemanship page twice! Some things will not
    make sense until you read the entire page.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As for someone telling you the horse is just
    hungry!....... you have to be crazy to
    believe that or have no clue of how horses
    think or live. I could not feed my horses for
    a week and they would not kick me, your horse
    kicks since it can, since you allow it, since
    you do not stop it, since you do not make the
    horse wish he never kicked you..... that is
    why your horse kicks, if someone thinks it is
    for food, then it will be for carrots, then
    will be to be with friends, then it will be
    not to get ridden, then it will be because
    you did not pet it right, then it will for
    ...................get the message... a horse
    needs to know it kicks for no reason or it
    knows it kicks for any reason, if you let it.
    You are in danger. This horse will hurt you
    if you do not get smart fast. He will not
    hurt you because he is mean, or dangerous, or
    aggressive, or untrainable, or because of his
    past, or because he is hungry..... he will do
    since he can and you have not taught him that
    he should not and can not! As for the horses
    charging each other, this is being done since
    they are kept alone, they have been taught,
    by keeping them isolated that is where they
    are safe and do not want anything new. Too
    bad, put the horses together and let them
    work it out.....DONT SAVE THEM, DON'T TRY AND
    STOP THEM, STAY OUT OF IT... I talk about
    this on my site about putting lots of food
    out in many different piles so they will not
    pay attention to the new member of herd.

    <p>Question: I have this horse it is a
    gelding its 15 hands tall and probably about
    1300 pounds its big.i want my dad to ride but
    were afraid he is to big he is 6'4" tall and
    325 pounds my question is would he break the
    horse down or hurt it if he kept it in a
    walk? or should he not ride it?</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Answer: Yes I agree, he is too big, a
    horse should only carry about 20% of its
    weight, if in shape, that does not mean add a
    few hundred pounds to get a higher 20%. Most
    horses today are over weight, 15 hands at
    1300 sounds like the horse is over weight.
    Once you add saddle and other stuff most
    horses carry 20 to 50 pounds more than what a
    person weighs. You did not say how old, a
    horse's back is not fully grown or developed
    until about 5 years old. Your questions is
    really way too simple. Way too many factors
    to consider, but I say no he is too
    heavy.</p>

            He is being a horse that is trying to
            test other horses and see if he can
            move up in the pecking order. The
            other horses could run away or chase
            him or make him stop if they wanted
            or could stay away from him. If you
            don't know is age, he may be younger,
            this it normally behavior of a
            younger horse around 4 or 5ish, but
            this horse could have been in a stall
            him entire life and does not know how
            to be a horse, how to be in a herd
            and is trying to figure it out.
              The herd will teach him
            in time, just let them work it out.
              A bite here and there and
            a kick here and there, is all normal
            horse stuff.   They are
            just being horses.</p>

            <p><br>
            ANSWER: I am a firm believer that a
            horse needs a herd.   A
            lone horse is miserable and develops
            emotional, mental and stress related
            problems.   I would put
            them both with the herd.
              Even a bottom horse plays
            a role and had a job in a herd.
              Every herd member is
            needed and valued in a herd.
              Even if you think the low
            horse only get pushed away, they are
            needed to keep the herd strong and
            always have a challenger.
              <br>
            <br>
            I say you are never doing a horse a
            favor by isolating him and thinking
            you are protecting or helping
            him.</p>

            <p>Put them in the herd, it will do
            everybody good, the herd will be
            bigger and feel safer, everyone will
            have a job and you will notice a
            change and see that they are all
            better for it.   It may
            take a week or two as much as a
            month, but stay out of it and let the
            herd work it out.</p>

            <p>Hi Jill, I got this questions in
            the questions pool.   This
            could be from many reasons, but I
            think it is a simple herd response.
              Any new herd member will
            affect the herd and behavior of all
            members.   First there are
            pecking order issues.
              since the donkey is
            smaller and may appear as a young
            colt, the geldings could be taking it
            under their wings and protecting it,
            this would bring out a much stronger
            leadership role from them.
              Before the donkey, the
            herd was set and not major issues so
            leadership was not that important,
            now they have a mission, they have a
            job and they are doing it well.
              As time goes on it may
            settle down, but anytime a new baby
            is introduced to a herd new stronger
            leaders emerge and they step up to
            the job of being protectors and
            leaders...   All horses are
            leaders and all are followers, it all
            depends who else is around as to
            which one the horse becomes.</p>

    <p>I noticed in the picture you have nylon
    halter, when means you have buckles and metal
    and probably a metal snap on your lead rope.
      I always suggest getting rid of
    all that and get a nice rope halter with a
    lead rope with NO snap.   This
    always seems to calm horses and give much
    better control.   Even thou control
    does not seem to be an issue, it will mean
    more and not scare the horse as much when you
    correct or say NO.<br>
    <br>
    As for the lips and mouthiness, this could be
    from lots of things.   Took from
    mom early, left on mom too long, insecure,
    curiosity, exploring, boredom and
    others.   My guess is boredom.
      I think most mouthy horses are
    smarter, they have been handled in a way that
    has not discouraged this and now they explore
    and are always learning.   Some say
    the tail chewing is a mineral or vitamin
    deficiency, not sure it that is true but make
    sure horse has a salt and mineral block
    available.   If a horse wants it to
    stop they will stop him from chewing, however
    in a stall or confined area, a horse would
    rather let it happen just to have horse
    contact so this tends to happen much more in
    stall environments.<br>
    <br>
    I did an article on this topic (nipping) and
    here is a link to it.<br>
    <br>http://thinklikeahorse.org/index-13.html#16

    <br>

    <br>
    I always see more so called problems and
    issues when horses are not kept in pasture
    with a herd.   Putting horses in at
    night, separating them create anxiety, which
    creates stress, which turns into vices
    (chewing, kicking, swaying, cribbing, wind
    sucking, etc.) Putting a horse out more,
    leaving them with friends and herds, and not
    locking them up always seem to help in most
    any situation.   It is almost like
    the cure all and it works more time than not.
      If you leave this horse out in in
    pasture with a herd for for two weeks, I
    would bet you a chewed lead rope that the
    behavior would stop are at least get a lot
    better.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is still a baby at 3, this will go
    away and get less as the horse gets closer to
    five.   I would not make a big deal
    about it.<br>
    <br>
    Let the horse spend time being a horse and
    not in a stall and the problem will fix it
    self.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Without seeing
    the horse no way to tell, but if he is not
    rolling I would think it is more than just
    saddle sore.   Rolling aligns the
    spine and helps stretch the back, if he is
    not rolling, it sounds more than saddle
    issues.   Riding is tough on the
    back, riding with a bad saddle is even worse,
    and jumping is the worst, so you are doing
    just about everything you could to put
    pressure and hurt the back.   I
    would not do anything until a vet or laser
    checks out.   As for bute, that can
    be bad since it hides pain and the horse will
    do things it should not do since it does not
    feel pain.   If you leave horse
    alone and no bute, it will not do anything
    that hurts, so you will see how bad it is, if
    you bute, you may think he is getting better,
    but he may not
    be..............................</p>

    <p>Well first you say he was neglected by the
    last owner and you are trying to get on him
    way too fast.   You are being a
    strong leader, you are not seen as the leader
    since the horse will telling you this by
    kicking and biting.   Just because
    this horse is gelded, it does not mean that
    he suddenly forgets how to be a
    stallion.   It can take months or a
    year for this change to take
    place.   You need to treat him like
    a horse, it does not matter if he is a stud
    or gelding, he gets treated as a lower
    horse.   You cannot be friends or
    nice to this horse until he knows you are the
    boss and decides not to push you or test you
    or move up over you.<br>
    <br>
    You do this by moving his feet, changing his
    direction, stopping him movement and making
    sure he knows you move him he does not move
    you, he does not bite your kick at you unless
    he wants a whole mess of trouble.  
    Trouble like you attacking his butt, you
    making him move that butt away from you to
    avoid getting hit with a rope, teaching him
    that anytime his butts gets near you, you are
    going to hit and get it, then he will not
    have time to think about kicking
    you.     When and if he
    tries to bite you, you drive your elbow into
    his mouth like you are trying to knock out
    his teeth.   It will only take once
    or twice and the biting will be
    done.  <br>
    <br>
    The only way you can help this horse is to
    push him like a crazy man and make him think
    you going to eat him if he messes with you,
    once that point is clear then you can slowly
    get nicer and kinder and start to build a
    relationship, but this horse has to know that
    you can and will get busy if he messes with
    you.   Threats and lite hits or
    slaps will only tell this horse you are weak,
    you have to let this horse know you are the
    boss, you are higher, you can move his feet,
    you can make him uncomfortable, you can make
    him run and if he wants to be comfortable, he
    has to play by your rules.   Tough
    love is what horses understand, it makes it
    clear to them and that is what they do and
    that is what they want.   He is
    being clear with you, he thinks you are
    lower, he thinks you are weak, he thinks he
    can take you, he thinks he can kick you, he
    thinks he can bite you.....he thinks this
    since you have not make it clear that he
    can't do any of those things.</p>

    <p>Young horses always get more bites
    (lessons) than older ones.   Young
    horses are immature, do not pay attention,
    want to explore and get into things and have
    not learned to respect higher
    horses.   This mare is teaching the
    youngster lessons in paying attention,
    respecting elders, pay attention to where you
    are and what I (a higher horse) is telling
    you.   If you don't pay attention
    this is what you get.   This will
    make it easier for you to train this horse
    later.   It may look worse than it
    really is.   The older he gets the
    less he get those hard lessons since he will
    learn to pay attention and listen.</p>

          <td valign="top">Ok you say you have 11
          years of experience and you are 16.
            I am going to tell you that
          your horse experience when you were 5,
          7, or 10, is not what I call horse
          experience.   You have horse
          exposure, but most people don't let
          kids on horses that will will hurt
          them, so the horses you have ridden or
          been with have probably not been
          problem or difficult horses.
            I am 48 years old and have
          many years of experience and there is
          still more about a horses that I don't
          know than I do know.   To
          fully understand horses would take a
          life time of study.   Most
          people who own horses never study them,
          they feed them, ride them and spend
          small amounts of time with them.
            You said your horse is not
          scared?   How do you know? It
          sounds to me that it is scared.
            So who is right, the horse
          is.   Only the horse knows
          what it is feeling, but we can sometime
          know what they are telling us.
            I think your horse is
          scared and does not see you as a strong
          leader that it trust.   So it
          gets insecure when she is only with
          you.   I always say it is the
          human's fault and NEVER the horse's
          fault.   Your horse is
          feeling something and it is up to you
          to figure it out.   The could
          be scared since it does not see you as
          a strong leader that it trust, so it
          wants to take over in order to keep
          herself safe.   </td>

    <p>ANSWER: Well, first I would say get her
    with another horse.   Just because
    she can see a horse, that does not give her a
    sense of security.   She needs to
    be with another horse so she can learn not to
    rear, learn some horse manners and be able to
    replace the loss of her mom.   She
    is nervous, scared and alone.   You
    say you have horse experience, but you are
    trying to use pain and control on a young
    horse that does not know anything.
      First I would say read more about
    horses so you understand their fear response
    and action.   You are going to
    spoil this nice filly, not on purpose, but
    from not dealing with this horse as a horse.
      You are still thinking like a
    person and not like a horse.<br>
    <br>
    This horse needs to learn that when something
    is on her nose or head, it will NOT hurt her.
      You are trying to over power and
    control this horse.   You should be
    trying to talk to her in horse so she can
    understand you and trying to communicate and
    convince her to cooperate with you and that
    you will not hurt.   You have
    failed to do this and now the little one is
    scared and does not trust you and is more
    worried about being hurt and trapped than in
    seeing you as a herd member and leader.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page on my site about
    herd behavior, if you read the entire page
    you will start to see horses different than
    you do now.   As I tell most
    people, this is not a horse problem it is a
    people (you) problem.   So you are
    asking for help, but you have to take the
    time to educate yourself about the horse, how
    they think, and how they react and why they
    react.   They are prey animals and
    we are predators, this is the most
    unnaturally combination that could
    exist.<br>
    <br>
    The best gift you can give a horse is
    knowledge and understanding about the
    horse.</p>

            <p>Your welcome, not blaming the
            horse is the first step in accepting
            responsibility.   It is a
            mindset that makes you improve
            yourself and then your horse gets
            better.   So your horse did
            not knock you down, you were in his
            way, you did not give him a better
            escape path, you did teach him to
            know run into or over you, you did
            see that he was getting scared and
            was not able to move out of his way,
            you were not paying close enough
            attention, you allowed the situation

                  what happens when are not
                  there.   First they
                  get to know each other then one
                  has to become higher, so they
                  are working out their herd.
                    Don't interfere,
                  stay out of it and let them be
                  horses.   The worst
                  thing for a horse is to be
                  alone, as you noticed when you
                  added they came together.
                    The need each other
                  to sleep and relax, but one has

                  aggression when you are there,
                  since the herd leader will want
                  to keep you for him self and he
                  thinks he should get any treats
                  you bring and the lower horse
                  should stand back and accept
                  his place as lower and must
                  respect the higher horse.
                    Once you out of the
                  equation they will do fine, but
                  they know when you come out
                  they get fed, the get attention
                  or treats or taken out and the
                  higher horse wants to be first
                  and wants to make sure the
                  lower horse stays back.
                    The lower horse
                  wants to come see you for
                  whatever reason and is ignoring
                  the higher horse, so he gets
                  disciplined.   This
                  will all go away as they
                  confirm their positions and

                  there is no reason for them to
                  push each other.
                    They only push for
                  food or mares or to

    <p>ANSWER: You are trying to treat him as if
    you feel sorry for him and as if you can make
    up for the bad that has happened to him.
      Forget that, treat him like a
    horse.   You are causing this
    behavior.   Accept that.
      You can change it and help this
    horse, but you have to understand horses and
    understand herd behavior.   Horses
    see the world as horses and herds, you and
    this horse is a herd of two.   In a
    herd you are either higher or lower.
      You are lower, you have told this
    horse you are lower, you act like you are
    lower and you let the horse treat you as if
    you are lower.   So you are causing
    this behavior.   Read my
    horsemanship page, you will see horses
    differently and will understand them better.
      This horse is lost and is asking
    for a leader, be that leader.   A
    horse feels safer and better if he has a
    strong leader that gives him good direction
    and makes the rules clear.   That
    don't mean you have to be mean or aggressive,
    but you do have to understand horses so you
    can talk to this horse in his language.
      You are talking human and the
    horse is confused.   The stress you
    are feeling the horse is feeling 10 times
    worse.   You have to be confident
    and aware, not strong as 40 year old.
      If you do it right you will not
    need much strength or power, you need to use
    your brain to learn so you can talk horse and
    communicate with this horse in a way he can
    understand and feel safe.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: Well there are always things you
    can do, it is if you are willing or able to.
      This horse has a troubled past,
    all race horses and most sport horses don't
    have very good lives.   They are
    not owned or cared about for anything other
    then to win and or make money.   It
    sounds like he found a great home and you
    given him a much better life than he would
    have had.   If he kept alone, then
    I would get him a buddy.   A horse
    needs other horses to feel safe, they all get
    very insecure when alone.   So all
    horses are what people call Buddy sour or
    herd bound, it is their instinct so they can
    stay alive and feel safe.   If he
    does not have another horse to play with, to
    sleep with, to graze with, to feel safe with,
    this only increases his drive to get to
    another horse.   So that is one
    thing.   Another option is to get a
    pony horse, take a second horse with you so
    he will have a buddy with him, once he gets
    good at that, then you slowly wean him off
    slowly.<br>
    <br>
    I think too many people try and prevent or
    stop too much.   Horses are smart
    and they can figure things out if people let
    them and help them.   The more you
    try and stop him and prevent him the more he
    feels trapped, restricted, and unable to
    move.   Horses rarely rear unless
    someone is restricting their movement,
    pulling on their mouth or head.
      Horses normally always pick to
    run if they can.   <br>
    <br>
    Look at this not has you have to try and
    prevent this.   If he wants to see
    horses, lets go see them, let him release
    that energy, let him satisfy his strong
    instinctual drive and go see the horses, then
    once he gets there he goes to work, not mean
    or mad, just work, he has to back up, flex,
    go in circles, change directions, anything to
    keep him busy and paying attention to you.
      Every time he is with other
    horse, no problem but you and him get to do
    lots of training and work, he may get to trot
    around the horses, he may get to follow them
    in reverse, he walks backwards to be with
    them while they walk forward, you want him to
    think, damn when I am with other horses, I
    get my butt worked off, soon he will think,
    it is easier to be away from horse so I can
    relax and not work so hard.   This
    will not happen after once or twice, it will
    take consistency on your part.
      Doing the same thing all the time
    so the horse Knows what to expect and has a
    choice.<br>
    <br>
    I think you, like many others, are so caught
    up in controlling him, making him listen,
    showing him who is boss, that you are making
    this a fight in stead of using the horse's
    natural drive and figuring out a way to use
    that drive to help train the horse.
      You have a natural draw that you
    horse wants, figure out ways to use that to
    work your horse and make you both better and
    stop focusing on how to stop that drive.
      He is just being a horse, work
    with this as your problem and not the
    horse's.   You are smarter, this
    horse has already taught you many lessons
    about horses and you have learned well, but
    don't stop.   He is making you try
    and learn different ways to handle a
    problems, embrace this as he is helping you
    get better, The horse is always the teacher,
    too many forget that and they thing they are
    the teacher or trainer.<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps,<br>
    <br>
    Read my site, and remember when you walk to
    pasture, don't just focus on the gate or your
    destination, don't walk a straight line, play
    with your horse on the way, give a treat,
    have him backup, spin him, disengage his
    hindquarters, give him something to think
    about it instead of the gate, have him paying
    attention to you and not the gate, show him
    you are a strong and confident leader and he
    will not want to get to the gate so fast, he
    will feel safe and will want to be with you.
      You cannot feel safe if you are
    scared or intimidated.   You feel
    this since you don't know and don't
    understand, read and learn, this will go
    away.   Knowledge is power.</p>

          lost an old friend and now a new
          younger herd member is there.
            He will snap out of it and
          will soon be with the herd.
            You can try and stimulate
          the herd by driving a car, tractor of
          other vehicle around them and just move
          them a bit, they will think they are
          being chased and will run as a herd and
          will all get closer.   All
          herd gets closer when there are
          threats.   So scaring them a
          bit will cause them to run together,
          but letting them work it out is best.
            They will come together
          once the pecking order is defined and
          set, this may take a few weeks.<br>
          <br>
          Don't separate them, horses always do
          better as a herd and are much worse off
          when alone or separated.
            Let the herd work it out,
          in a few months you will see one herd

    <p>ANSWER: As usual, this is a people created
    problem and not a horse issue.
      These horses are doing what
    horses do, they push lower horses, they try
    and establish dominance so they can be higher
    in the pecking order.   The herd
    has to have a strict pecking order to ensure
    the survival of the herd.   Only
    the strongest horse can be leader, so horse
    have to test each other to see who is higher
    and who is longer.   Totally
    normal.   However, when people put
    up fences, hot wires, gates, and dividers,
    trying to protect the horse and to feel like
    they are keeping their horse safe, they make
    it worse.   A horse does best and
    feels best when he is in a herd.
      All horses bite and all get bit,
    all kick and all get kicked, it is the way of
    the horse.<br>
    <br>
    Understanding herd behavior will help you and
    your horse, since a horse does the same
    things to people since the horse sees their
    world as a herd and you are either higher or
    lower in the herd.<br>
    <br>
    I go into this subject in more detail on my
    horsemanship page of my site.</p>

    <p>I still think the aggression is caused by
    us getting involved.   I never
    rescue a horse from a herd.   The
    horse needs to learn to show respect and to
    treat the higher horses correctly, per the
    herd.   This gelding is probably
    more aggressive since the he thinks this mare
    is his and all horse get more aggressive when
    new horses are introduced since they do not
    want to move down in the pecking order and
    there are benefits to being higher.
      The fact that this gelding cannot
    correct the other gelding and cannot push
    him, make his show respect and since the
    other gelding feels safe and does not run
    away, he is showing disrespect to the higher
    caged horse, so this increases the
    aggression.   One horse feels safe
    and show disrespect and the other horses
    can't correct him and is trapped so once
    again I say "we, people cause this to be a
    bigger deal and make it worse by trying to
    protect or help"   Horses have
    survived for thousands of years without your
    help or my help, but then we, being the know
    it all humans, want to think we can do it
    better and we need to help and we need to
    protect, and we need to get involved.
      We don't and when we do, the
    horse has to pay for our meddling and it is
    worse on the horse, so what do we (you) do,
    you get more involved and try to help more by
    putting up hot wires and bigger fences, so
    the aggression gets worse and more intense
    and continues because it is never settled, it
    is never worked out and somehow, we want to
    blame the horse for being "mean or really
    aggressive". IT IS NEVER THE HORSES FAULT.
      So put up hot wires, put up
    bigger fences and protect this horse and when
    one day the two horses meet or one gets out
    and one or both horses get hurt or has to be
    put down, know that it will be your fault for
    trying to protect them.<br>
    <br>
    Somehow I think you are going to do what you
    want to do and no matter what I say is going
    to change things.   So I am somehow
    confused as to what you are looking for.
      I gave you my advice and opinion,
    I gave a reference page and told you what I
    think is the problem.<br>
    <br>
    I am trying to be the voice of the horse and
    you want to tell me you have never seen such
    an aggressive horse.   I know
    horses pretty well and I think these horses
    are the way they are because of people
    sticking their nose in the natural order of
    herds and trying to protect things that do
    much better without human interference.
      I stand by my take on this
    situation and my suggestion stands, put the
    horses out in a pasture, let them work it out
    and it will be done and over in a few days
    and they will all be buds and will be one
    structured safe, close herd.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: You need to be careful walking
    this pony, if he is nipping at your knees he
    is showing you dominance.   He will
    get away from you and run away and may get
    hit by a car.   This horse knows
    that you do not know anything horses so he is
    testing you and figuring out.   I
    keep a safe distance from him, ever time he
    gets away with a bite, a head toss, a pull,
    buck or rear, he will shortly be kicking and
    he will kick you hard and could hurt you very
    badly even if he is small.   <br>
    <br>
    If you really want to understand horses, read
    my site, it will help.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Well you have a few options.
      You can ring a bell every time
    you feed and the horses will learn to come
    running when they hear the bell or feed pan
    banging or whatever else you want to use.
      Then you can either put some food
    in one stall and then lock the lead mare in
    while the others eat.   <br>
    <br>
    I would just teach them not to fight.
      They only fight for competition
    over the food.   If the herd is
    established, been together for more than a
    month or two, then just put out food near the
    stalls in different piles at least two horse
    lengths apart.   If you have 3
    horses, put out five or six piles, if you
    have 4 horse put our 7 or 8 piles.
      This will get less over time, but
    at first you want to have lots of piles so
    they can all get pushed off and will have
    another pile to go to.   That way
    there is no reason to fight for only one or
    two piles.   So after a week or so
    of this they will get tired of chasing each
    other off and will know that all piles are
    the same so no reason to push.   As
    time goes by, each week, go down one pile
    until you have the same number of piles as
    horses.   The fewer piles the more
    apart they need to be, after they adjust to
    one pile each, then you can slowly move them
    closer and soon you will see them share.
      The more secure the horse is with
    their position, the less they will need to
    push each other off to prove their pecking
    order.   It will take time, but
    don't RUSH it or it will take longer and will
    get worse.<br>
    <br>
    Food is the number one reason horses fight,
    so as long as they become secure with the
    herd, they will not see the need to fight.
      If two horses don't get along,
    they will stay away from each other as long
    as they know they have a pile to go to.
      If you put food in both stalls,
    they should learn to eat in one stall, maybe
    the head mare will push at first but it will
    get easier as they get to know each
    other.<br>
    <br>
    Give them time to herd up and become buddies
    before you try and get them to share food.
      The slow way is the fast way with
    horses.Well you want a horse and a horse
    wants other horses.   Keeping this
    horse by itself will make her act out,
    develop bad habits and can make her mean to
    people.<br>
    <br>
    If you can afford one horse then you should
    not have a horse   or keep it with
    other horses.   You will have
    continued problems with her keeping her
    alone.   You have already seen this
    develop in just four months, in a year it
    will be much worse.   <br>
    <br>
    You say the horses are mean at the other
    place, this tells me you do not understand
    horses very well.   Horses are not
    mean, people are mean and make horses mean.
      Horses are herd animals not
    solitary pets.   If you really
    understand horses you would never have got a
    baby and planned on keeping it alone.<br>
    <br>
    Some may tell you to get a goat, get a cat or
    some other animal, a horse needs another
    horse, they need a herd to feel safe or it
    creates many problems, you are seeing just a
    few.</p>

    <p>The problem is you, since you ride her
    then you are causing this.   Horses
    only have problems when people create them.
      You need to pay more attention to
    what you are doing.   What is
    happening when she does this.   Are
    you pulling on the bit are you trying to make
    do something she does not want to do, is it
    the same thing, is the same area.<br>
    <br>
    This sounds like she is sour about you riding
    her too hear or too fast, a common problem
    with show or competing horses.<br>
    <br>
    Ground work may help but only if you change,
    you can't expect your horse to change if you
    keep doing the same thing.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site about round penning and sacking
    out, both will increase your horse's respect,
    if you do it right.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>  Well I like your last
    questions "what am I doing wrong".
      I am a firm believer that most
    horse problems are our problems and not the
    horse.   Here is what you said,
    recently bought, working with horse, have him
    step out of my space, move his hindquarters,
    step to side, consistently backing him out of
    my space, he gives ugly face, hard to buddy
    up, he has lousy attitude "towards me", I
    drive him away.....   This is from
    a one paragraph email and if I was this horse
    I would not want to be around you either.
      I see and hear a lot of things
    here and mostly with you.<br>
    <br>
    You appear to be good at being a pushy
    leader, you know how to push a horse around
    good, you know how to show a horse you won't
    be weak, but I don't think you know how to
    listen to horse.   Anyone can push
    a horse around it does not take much
    horsemanship, but it takes work and
    understanding to be flexible enough to
    listen, to try and help the horse find the
    right answer and not force or make the horse
    obey and be a slave.   A horse pins
    his ears for other reasons than to be
    disrespectful, they can do it when scared or
    backed in a corner or feel they are about to
    pushed or bullied.   <br>
    <br>
    This horse is only four, he is still a baby
    in my book, even thought he is big strong and
    can kill you, he is still a baby mentally.
      You don't know his entire
    history, how he was treated, mistreated or
    abandoned.   So from the horse's
    view here is what I think he sees.
      Great another human that wants to
    push me around, I get taken to a new place
    with new and unfamiliar surroundings, I get
    taken from my friends and comfort, I am
    ripped away from where I felt safe and now in
    the strange place with strange surroundings,
    I get this human that acts like she wants to
    be my friend but all she does is come in push
    me around, tell me I have a lousy attitude
    and acts like a leader that is not confident
    or secure since she is always SHOWING me she
    can push me around????   So why
    should I trust her, why should I believe her,
    why should I follow her and put my like in
    her hands?<br>
    <br>
    There is a saying that goes "A good horseman
    can hear a horse talk, a great horseman can
    hear a horse whisper, but a bad horseman
    can't hear a horse even if it screams."<br>
    <br>
    Not saying you are bad, just think you need
    to back away from all the DVDs, clinics,
    books and people that say, "Show them who is
    boss", "make him respect your space"... and
    all the other advice from those who don't
    know or really understand a horse.<br>
    <br>
    A horse is a reflection of the owner, look at
    the way you act around this horse and see if
    you are type of person you would want to be
    around if you were a horse.   Try
    listening and understanding where this horse
    is coming from, why he does what he does,
    what are you doing to cause him to do what he
    is doing, what you can do to help find the
    right answer.   You are old enough
    to advance and grow in your horsemanship past
    the beginner stage of pushing a horse
    around.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is giving you an opportunity to
    grow, he is trying to teach the way of the
    horse, he will help understand better and
    grow, if you step back and listen and become
    the student and not the teacher.<br>
    <br>
    Cut him some slack and you might be surprised
    how fast he comes around.   Spend
    time with him, show him that you can be
    around him and with him without pushing or
    requiring things from him, build a
    relationship of trust and partnership and not
    of owner or boss and employee.
      Only you can change what you are
    doing, if you do the horse will as
    well.<br>
    <br>

    <hr>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>All the issues you talked about are
    normal, she is used to be ridden in open
    lands without all this scary stuff going on.
      I think you are trying to handle
    it wrong with MAKING HER STAND, this shows me
    that you do not understand a horse.
      A horse's worst fear is to be
    trapped and unable to run since running is
    how they stay alive, so this horse is being
    normal.   She is bucking since you
    are probably hurting her when you MAKE her
    stand and stop her feet from moving.
      You are getting scared and
    insecure since you are seeing her fear
    increase, because of you. Forget that you
    rode many years ago that means nothing to me
    or the horse.   The horse does not
    care how good you are, how many medals you
    may have won, a horse wants to feel safe with
    you and see you as a strong and capable
    leader.   If you are pulling on the
    reins, MAKING the horse stand when she is
    scared only makes her not trust you, makes
    her think you do not know much about a horse
    and makes her not want to be with you.
      You don't want her to run since
    you are scared.   Stop trying to
    MAKE her deal with her fear and start helping
    her deal with it.   Show her it is
    ok to be scared and you will help her and not
    hurt her,   and not force her or
    MAKE her do anything.   I would say
    you are more scared than you were in your
    younger years and are more careful and are
    more nervous about getting hurt, your horse
    reads all this and reacts to it.
      When you deal with your fear
    better, your horse will deal with her's
    better.<br>
    <br>
    As for you comment about if you return the
    horse it will end up at the abattoir, this
    sounds very selfish and is does show a
    favorable side of you.   You say
    you have come attached to the horse and then
    say you know it will be killed if you give it
    back and then say YOU WANT a pony you can
    ride and not just a pet.   So let
    me get this right, as long as the horse lets
    you scare the crap out of it by forcing next
    to fast and dangerous traffic, then you will
    keep it, otherwise you send back to someone
    you know will kill it.<br>
    <br>
    Welcome to the world of horses, people use
    them, take from them and when they don't do
    everything just how we want, we get rid of
    them.   I would rather see you take
    the horse to open land and let her free and
    let it take her chances with the wild animals
    than sentence her to a sure death by
    returning her. Who knows, by setting her free
    maybe someone will find her who loves horses,
    loves their beauty and will take care of her
    just for joy of sharing with them and having
    them in their life.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Well, you got me.   I have never
    seen this or heard of this.
      Without knowing more about the
    herd dynamics it is hard to say.
      I have seen stallions kill babies
    or another stallion, I have seen mares
    severely discipline young horses, but not
    seen a young mare try and take out a gelding.
      I was not there but are you sure
    it was not playful?   Another thing
    could be she thought he was in pain and
    dying, so she was trying to end it for him.
      No one knows for sure how deep
    horses think.   Horses in the wild
    will sometime towards a pack of wolves if
    they are injured or dying almost as it to say
    end it fast.<br>
    <br>
    Not knowing the condition of your gelding,
    the relationship with the herd, maybe this
    mare was not trying to kill him and was just
    trying to move up in the pecking order.
      <br>
    <br>
    We can only guess, but I would have to go
    with my gut and say that keeping them apart
    and them together is a factor.
      This messes up the herd dynamics
    and don't allow things to get settled, worked
    out and established.   I find it
    hard to believe that by the time you saw
    this, reacted, ran out to pasture and got to
    your gelding that if she wanted him dead, he
    would be dead, but I was not there.<br>
    <br>
    So that is my take, sorry I could not be more
    specific.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Without seeing you I can't be for sure.
      But your horse is telling you
    that you are not communicating right, that
    you are not sending clear signals, that he
    does not understand what you want, that he
    does not see you as his leader.<br>
    <br>
    Round penning does not make friends, it
    teaches a horse to hear you, to learn what
    you are asking, to understand that you can
    move his feet, you can stop his feet and you
    and control his direction and speed.
      It seems the horse has taught you
    these lessons.<br>
    <br>
    Release is the key to teaching horses.
      I discuss this in my round
    penning section on my horsemanship page of my
    web site.   Read that and it should
    clear things up, if you still don't
    understand after you read that, write me
    back.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: Horses are very protective of
    their herd. She sees you as her herd member
    and is protecting you and telling other
    horses that you belong to her.
      This can be bad, since if she
    sees you as lower than her she will start
    telling you what to do and if you don't
    listen she will treat you as her herd
    member.</p>

    <p>Well it depends.   Right with
    horses is very subjective.   Most
    people, including me, keep their horses a
    little more padded.   Too much
    weight is bad for the horse, bad for legs and
    feet, but unfed horses are not good either.
      I would say it is a lot like
    people, being a little thin is better than
    being a little over weight. I do not like
    seeing ribs, I like to be able to at least
    feel and find ribs, some horse are so fat I
    can't find a rib.   So there is a
    happy medium.   <br>
    <br>
    As for this guy, I think he if full of horse
    pucky.   Unless she is being worked
    very hard she should not be losing weight
    unless she is not getting good food.
      I know lots of jerks that will
    take good hay and feed crap hay to cut their
    cost.   So if you provide hay, she
    may be fed other junk.   That is
    why I don't letter people feed or handle my
    horses.   Your horse is your
    responsibility.   You put the horse
    there, you allowed someone else to care for
    it and you let your horse be neglected, since
    I think this horse is definitely being
    neglected.   I know all the
    reasons, you are busy, you are unable, you
    could not help it, you have kids, you have a
    job, none that mean crap to your horse that
    is not being fed.   Horses will eat
    their own crap if they are not fed.
      So the sniffing means she is
    probably already doing this since she is so
    hungry and unfed.<br>
    <br>
    Get your horse out, report this guy to the
    local law enforcement for abuse, and post to
    note at the local feed stores that this guy
    is a cheat and does not feed horses at his
    place.<br>
    <br>
    Back to your horse, if you don't let other
    care for your horse, you would not have any
    of these problems, but problems for you is
    not my concern, your horse has to pay for
    your mistakes.   Make it right.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>I get a lot of this questions.
      I can't fix a horse over the
    email and don't want you to think I can, only
    your or your daughter or someone handling the
    horse can show it what it can and cannot do.
      Beating the horse after it
    happens does nothing.   Prevention
    is better than treatment.   If you
    are there when something happens, and can
    correct the horse within 3 seconds of it
    happening then correct away, anything after 3
    seconds the horse just learns to dislike
    people and may get mean.   This
    horse is just being a horse.   I
    just answered another questions about this so
    I am going to paste the answer so you can
    read it.<br>
    <br>
    Previous answer.   You are doing
    ground work and making the horse respect you
    may or may not help your daughter.
        I would lean more to
    will not help enough.   If horses
    are handled more by good leaders and by
    people that understand horses, then they
    become less resistance to all people.
      However, if they are handled more
    by kids, not strong leaders or people that
    don't understand horses, then they tend to
    not respect all people and will test and push
    people more.   <br>
    <br>
    I get questions from parents a lot and I tell
    them mostly the same, since you are asked the
    question and you are doing research and you
    are trying to improve your knowledge, that
    means nothing to the horse when the child is
    handling her.   <br>
    <br>
    So anytime you can get a horse more in tune
    to respect you, then he MAY be less likely to
    test your daughter.   But, since he
    already knows your daughter is weak (to her)
    I think she will continue to disrespect her
    and push her.<br>
    <br>
    I am reluctant to tell parents to make their
    kid learn.   Horses are something
    that should be fun, when medals, awards,
    ribbons and speed or time is involved, the
    horse and child loses.   <br>
    <br>
    You can make your daughter read books about
    horses, try and educate her about horses.
      You can make up some test to give
    her from what you have learned.   I
    see too many kids being mean to horses
    because their parents told me to "show the
    horse who is boss".   The horse
    knows she is stronger and can push your D
    around.   You can only change this
    if you handle the horse more, are with your
    daughter all the time (hard to do) so you can
    correct the horse if is disrespectful to your
    daughter.   Older horses will
    protect and keep higher horses away from the
    weak or younger horses in a herd, but they
    are there all the time so it works.<br>
    <br>
    I have seen kids that get it, they understand
    horses without being mean, they simply push
    and move the horse every time the horse
    pushes them, but they are consistent and do
    it all the time so the horse stops testing
    and stops pushing so much.
      Consistency with kids is not
    always easy, they get distracted easy, they
    just want to relax, have fun and not be so
    worried, like adults.   <br>
    <br>
    I would have your daughter read books while
    sitting with the horse, spend time with the
    horse, the more time she spends with the
    horse, since this horse is the lead mare, she
    may take her under her wing and see her as
    her herd and not want to push her so much,
    the flip side to this is the horse will
    expect your D to listen to her so she may
    correct her like another horses, with a bite
    or kick.<br>
    <br>
    This can be a dangerous situation, since your
    D knows this horse will kick she needs to be
    away and make sure she always has an escape
    and distance from the horse.   If
    she acts too scared the horse will see this
    as weakness and will exploit it.
      Any time the horse shows any
    signs of ear pinning, kicks, or bites with
    you there, you need to make this horse think
    it just committed suicide, any disrespect to
    your child needs to be addressed immediately,
    not 5 mins later or not after your child
    leaves, tells you and then you go out and
    give it a lesson, if you can't correct it
    within 3 seconds, it is too late and will not
    train the horse and will only make the horse
    fear you and people and may make the horse
    more aggressive towards people.<br>
    <br>
    So your situation is not unique, but there is
    not an easy answer either.   Read
    my site and try to really understand horses
    better and then see if you can come up with
    ways pass this on to your D, have her do
    exercises with the horse, in order to teach
    her, you must first know the
    subject.  </p>
    <hr>

    <p>Don't blame the horse for anything, it is
    only being a horse, it lives in your world
    and is trying to figure out the rules and
    when it doubt it will do what horses do.
      In your photo I think I see that
    you are using a leverage bit.
      This is painful and hurts the
    horse, it will not teach respect and will
    teach the horse pain and more resistance.
      If your daughter can't ride this
    horse   in a halter, then she
    should not be riding it.   No spurs
    and no leverage bits for kids, it only pisses
    the horse off and gets kids hurt.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>So I would keep your daughter away from
    the horse's feet.   You did not
    tell how old your daughter is so that would
    matter.   Just because you say your
    daughter is a competent rider does not mean
    she understands horses, does not mean she
    understand around respect, fear, pressure,
    release, advance, retreat, pushing back, what
    a horse test is, why horses test, what to do
    to get the horse's trust and respect...
      I know lots and lots of people,
    older adults, that have "ridden their entire
    life" and "owned horses their entire life"
    and they can no more answer these or know
    this either, but they will be the first to
    tell you how to fix things and how to handler
    things.<br>
    <br>
    Knowledge and understanding of the horse will
    help you and keep you safer than than $10,000
    worth of the best and fanciest equipment and
    all the advice in the world from the best so
    called trainers, clinicians or "life long
    horse owners".<br>
    <br>
    Read and study the horse so you have the
    knowledge to fix this.   Selling
    and buying horses cost more than the expense
    and time.   It is bad for horses,
    it is bad for you and you will NEVER get what
    you are told, since all you get is a horse,
    after that, you teach the horse bad or good.
      So I could give you the best
    horse in world and in a few weeks or a month,
    you or your daughter could teach it to kick,
    be disrespectful, buck, run off, pull, or you
    could teach it to continue to be the best
    horse in world.   The horse you buy
    is not the issue, what you do with a horse
    teaches and trains a horse.</p>
    <hr>
    It sounds like you are doing some right
    things.   The answer to your
    question yes and no. You doing ground work
    and making the horse respect you may or may
    not help your daughter.
        I would lean more to
    will not help enough.   If horses
    are handled more by good leaders and by
    people that understand horses, then they
    become less resistance to all people.
      However, if they are handled more
    by kids, not strong leaders or people that
    don't understand horses, then they tend to
    not respect all people and will test and push
    people more.   <br>

    <p><br>
    I get questions from parents a lot and I tell
    them mostly the same, since you are asked the
    question and you are doing research and you
    are trying to improve your knowledge, that
    means nothing to the horse when the child is
    handling her.   <br>
    <br>
    So anytime you can get a horse more in tune
    to respect you, then he MAY be less likely to
    test your daughter.   But, since he
    already knows your daughter is weak (to her)
    I think she will continue to disrespect her
    and push her.<br>

    I am reluctant to tell parents to make their
    kid learn.   Horses are something
    that should be fun, when medals, awards,
    ribbons and speed or time is involved, the
    horse and child loses.   <br>
    <br>
    You can make your daughter read books about
    horses, try and educate her about horses.
      You can make up some test to give
    her from what you have learned.   I
    see too many kids being mean to horses
    because their parents told me to "show the
    horse who is boss".   The horse
    knows she is stronger and can push your D
    around.   You can only change this
    if you handle the horse more, are with your
    daughter all the time (hard to do) so you can
    correct the horse if is disrespectful to your
    daughter.   Older horses will
    protect and keep higher horses away from the
    weak or younger horses in a herd, but they
    are there all the time so it works.<br>
    <br>
    I have seen kids that get it, they understand
    horses without being mean, they simply push
    and move the horse every time the horse
    pushes them, but they are consistent and do
    it all the time so the horse stops testing
    and stops pushing so much.
      Consistency with kids is not
    always easy, they get distracted easy, they
    just want to relax, have fun and not be so
    worried, like adults.   <br>
    <br>
    I would have your D read books while sitting
    with the horse, spend time with the horse,
    the more time she spends with the horse,
    since this horse is the lead mare, she may
    take her under her wing and see her as her
    herd and not want to push her so much, the
    flip side to this is the horse will expect
    your D to listen to her so she may correct
    her like another horses, with a bite or
    kick.<br>
    <br>
    This can be a dangerous situation, since your
    D knows this horse will kick she needs to be
    away and make sure she always has an escape
    and distance from the horse.   If
    she acts too scared the horse will see this
    as weakness and will exploit it.
      Any time the horse shows any
    signs of ear pinning, kicks, or bites with
    you there, you need to make this horse think
    it just committed suicide, any disrespect to
    your child needs to be addressed immediately,
    not 5 mins later or not after your child
    leaves, tells you and then you go out and
    give it a lesson, if you can't correct it
    within 3 seconds, it is too late and will not
    train the horse and will only make the horse
    fear you and people and may make the horse
    more aggressive towards people.<br>
    <br>
    So your situation is not unique, but there is
    not an easy answer either.   Read
    my site and try to really understand horses
    better and then see if you can come up with
    ways pass this on to your D, have her do
    exercises with the horse, in order to teach
    her, you must first know the
    subject.  </p>
    <hr>

    <p>Don't blame the horse for anything, it is
    only being a horse, it lives in your world
    and is trying to figure out the rules and
    when it doubt it will do what horses do.
      In your photo I think I see that
    you are using a leverage bit.
      This is painful and hurts the
    horse, it will not teach respect and will
    teach the horse pain and more resistance.
      If your daughter can't ride this
    horse   in a halter, then she
    should not be riding it.   No spurs
    and no leverage bits for kids, it only pisses
    the horse off and gets kids hurt.</p>

    <p>Horses normally don't trust sexes, they
    either trust or don't trust people.
      I have worked with many horses
    that I have been told they do not like men,
    but they had no problem with me.
      A horse has a keen sense for
    reading people, so they size people up.
      Men tend to be a little more
    direct and aggressive or assertive.
      Women tend to be more passive,
    soft and slow, a fearful horse will normally
    be more fearful of direct or assertive
    people.   A good horseman can tone
    this down or turn it up.   It is
    not a horse problem, it is a people
    problem.<br>
    <br>
    If you just feed a horse he will not respect
    you or see you as his leader.   You
    have to require things from a horse to get
    them to respect you.   So move
    them, make them move, make them see you as a
    leader who can move them, otherwise they move
    you, they run from you, they learn you cannot
    stop them, you cannot control their
    direction, speed, or stop them, so they think
    they are smarter and they should be leader
    and they should not submit to your leadership
    or direction.</p>
    <hr>
    I have a section on my web site about horses
    that have not been handled. Lots of pressure
    and release (advance and retreat) you can
    keep him enclosed for a week or so, but if he
    was with other horses he will be nervous and
    it may be better to let him in the herd for a
    couple of weeks so he can feel safe at his
    new place.   Don't baby him and try
    to be too slow and careful.   Be
    normal and lots of pressure and release.
      The most important thing for new
    young ones are sacking out, get him to handle
    his fear.   You said he is colt, if
    he is not gelded that should happen by three
    or so, I like to wait longer some do early,
    the longer you wait the better I think.
      Reading my site will help you
    understand horses better, lots of handling
    will help later, don't baby him and let him
    push you, pin his ears, kick or bite, he has
    to be taught that any behavior like that is
    bad and will get him pushed hard so he better
    not do it.

    <p>Well without seeing this first hand, it is
    hard to tell for sure.   It may be
    a slight resistance showing in the ears, she
    may not like to trot and shows this with her
    ears.   If it not progressing to
    anything more serious, it may go away with
    time.   Not sure if she does this
    while on a lunge line, but you could try and
    round pen her, change her speed and direction
    until she really looks to you for relief.
      She will look and ask if she will
    ask to stop and when she does her ears will
    go forward to you, timing is important, so
    stop and release immediately the second her
    ears go forward, no pressure, once you get
    her to associate ears forward with release,
    then you can work on how long her ears are
    forward before she gets release.
      <br>
    <br>
    Again not knowing everything, ears back is
    common sign of being sour and not enjoying
    her job.   Too much work and not
    enough play and relaxing time together can
    cause this, and I always get defensive
    responses when I say this, but if you are not
    doing this then don't worry about, but
    remember just because you or someone else
    thinks it is not too much, the horse is the
    one that determines this, not people.
      Just something else to
    consider.<br>
    <br>
    The other thing is maybe joint pain, other
    pain or saddle issues.   I always
    try and provoke the response so I can see if
    I can create it so then I can figure out how
    to stop it.   When I am told,
    something happens and I don't know why, I
    don't believe this.   Something
    causes this response, you, the trot, pain,
    sourness, respect issues, something, until
    you determine what causes it, it is hard to
    fix.<br>
    <br>
    I would trot her on line, off line, towards
    me, with a tight rein, loose rein, no leg,
    lots of leg, small circles, large circles,
    straight, slow trot, fast trot, leaning back,
    leaning forward, do everything you can to
    change the trot, NOT all at once or in one
    day, just explore ways to see if you cause
    this response, then it may give you a better
    way to deal with it.</p>

    <p>As I said before this is about the horse
    feeling safe and secure with you and seeing
    you as a strong leader.   Only you
    change this.   You need to really
    understand a horse to change it.
      You can guess at it, you can't
    try, you can't have someone else do it, you
    have study horses, understand them, know how
    they think, how they act, what they respond
    to and what they fear.   Once you
    understand all that you can show the horse
    you understand them, you can talk to the
    horse in their language, they will know you
    understand them and that you are the leader
    and they will trust you and see you as the
    leader.   When all this happens
    most all other problems go away.
      But all of this is about you.
      Your horse is only a horse.
      But until you really understand
    what a horse is all about, you cannot address
    any problem.   So read my
    horsemanship page and my horseman tips page,
    it will help you see horses differently and
    that will be the first step in fixing what
    you are doing so the problem will go away.
      That is the problem of her
    behavior when you are handling her.
      As for the being alone part, let
    her be with other horses as much as you can.
      The more she is with other
    horses, the less she will be acting out to
    get to other horses.</p>

          <td valign="top">I get this question a
          hundred times a year.   Only
          you can fix this with you and only your
          son can fix it with him.   A
          horse needs a strong leader, he needs
          to know his boundaries and know who is
          alpha, this is a very strong instinct
          with horses.   Your trainer
          is right in one way, but I don't agree
          with him completely.   The
          herd dynamic has little to do with you
          or your son.   When your
          horse is with you, you and your horse
          is a herd of two.   So no
          matter how horses are in a herd of
          horses, when you take him out, it is
          now just you and him.   So
          you are the problem, you need to give
          this horse better direction, you need
          to understand horses better so you can
          help this horse.   This is
          NOT bad or acting out, or being mean,
          he is being a totally normal horse.
            You are causing this
          behavior by confusing your horse, not
          making the rules clear, not being a
          strong and clear leader and not giving
          this horse good, consistent, clear
          direction, so he gets confused and
          thinks he has to take over, so he does.
            He treats you like a lower
          horse in his herd since you act like a
          lower horse.   He is only
          being a horse with strong instincts to
          either be led or to follow.
            If you lead he will follow,
          if you allow him to lead he will lead.
            I tell people this all the
          time.   Read my web site,
          maybe it will take you a while, maybe 4
          or 5 hours, not in one day but read it,
          you will see horses differently after
          you read it.   You will
          understand them better.
            Read other books, learn and
          study the horse, they are complex and
          very unique animals that most horse
          owners never see.   This
          horse is looking for a leader and you
          are not it and he knows it, so he
          thinks he has to move up and pick up
          the slack since when he is with you,
          you are unsure, not specific, not clear
          with you directions, not clear with
          when you ask something there is only
          one right answer.   You are
          trying to be nice and loving and
          caring, horses don't care about that,
          they want a good strong leader, that is
          whey makes them feel safe, that is what
          makes them want to be with you,
          anything else is weak and confusing to
          a horse.<br>
          <br>
          As for your herd situation, I would
          absolutely put your mare back in a
          herd.   Horses play, correct,
          train, release stress and many others
          things in a herd.   Without a
          herd, horses act out and get confused
          and question their position and
          existence.   Put horses
          together every chance you get.
            All geldings just want to
          play, with a mare they have purpose,
          they will push and fight to be better,
          to be a leader to be the one that
          impresses the mare and will want to be
          seen as a leader, as strong, it makes
          them better.</td>

    <p>What you are describing does not make
    sense.   I don't know you or the
    horse, but I never assume it is the horse's
    fault, so I normally address the problem as
    it is owner created.   This sounds
    like dominant and fear related behavior.
      So without seeing it, it is hard
    to diagnose.   I would make sure
    his ears and eyes are good, lots of strange
    behavior happens when a horse start losing
    sight since they are confused and scared, so
    they can get more aggressive.
      Since you say he is doing this to
    other horses as well as people, it leads me
    to believe it is physical and not handling.
      However, even if it is physical,
    if he felt safe and secure with a strong
    human handler, and received good, fair
    handling, he would not do what he is doing.
      <br>
    <br>
    Having a nine year old (without much
    experience) ride and handle the horse would
    be my next guess and I would say it 85
    percent that this is the issue.
      Kids don't understand release,
    pressure, fear instincts and how a horse
    thinks.   Horses only put up with
    pressure from higher horses, period.
      A small child is training a horse
    that is larger and stronger and they are
    smaller, less experience, can't control a
    horse and teach many other bad lessons.
      Even very experience small
    children have a hard time convincing a horse
    that they are alpha and they are higher.
      Normally kids resort to pain,
    fear, bit bits, stud chains and bully
    techniques.   This can make a horse
    sour.     The other side
    is they are too nice and just feed and baby
    and pamper the horse and the horse see this
    as weakness, does not respect them so the
    horse pushes a little, tests a lot and learns
    that they are really stronger and smarter, so
    the horse becomes alpha.   I would
    try and find a good horse person.
      This term is very subjective.
      A good horse person is not just
    someone who says they are good or someone who
    says they are a trainer, or someone who has
    owned horses forever, I mean a horseman,
    someone who is quite, soft, yet very
    effective with horses.   Find one
    of these if you can and have them take a look
    and handle the horse, if the behavior is
    stopped and or prevented then the answer is
    clear, it is you, your daughter or others who
    handle the horse, that is the problem.
      <br>
    <br>
    Most times when people ask me a questions it
    is always what is wrong with my horse he does
    x y z, when all the problems are looked at
    from it is the horse's problem, it normally
    means it is NOT the horse.   Anyone
    who truly understands horses, knows it is
    never the horse's fault and people cause
    every problem a horse has.   So
    when someone asked me to help their horse, I
    know they don't understand horses, when
    someone ask me to help them, then I know I
    have a willing person.<br>
    <br>
    This horse has been shown at shows, been
    trailered out a lot, been put in strange
    stalls, been forced into to scary situations
    at new arenas, new horses, unfamiliar
    environments, taken away from his friends and
    herd and handled and WORKED for ribbons and
    prizes.   Although you may blanket
    him, feed him good grain, brush him and give
    him find stables, NONE of this is what a
    horse really needs.   <br>
    <br>
    A horse needs love, quality time, time with a
    herd, time with people WHEN THEY ARE NOT
    REQUIRING THINGS OF HIM, just time being with
    him and enjoying him.   People
    never want to hear that they are the problem
    and they are causing a horse to do bad
    behavior.   From my experience, I
    think this horse is soured and has had
    enough.   He wants to be left
    alone, he does not want to be someone's
    pretty pony to win medals and ribbons, he
    only wants to be a horse, since that is what
    he born to be.   So he has finally
    said enough is enough.   He has
    figured out that the only way to get people
    from using him, pushing him is to act out, to
    take charge and to be aggressive.
      This happens to race horses all
    the time.   If you find another a
    good horseman in your area and they handle
    this horse with no problem then it will
    confirm my assessment.   Fixing
    this is whole new issue.   First
    you have to accept that you caused it and
    want to fix it or you can keep looking for
    other reasons, spending vet bills, trying
    different food, get bigger bits, try a stud
    chain or some other crazy ideas that people
    use to "fix" horses since they can't accept
    that they (or their child) are problem.<br>
    <br>
    The only thing you have said that makes me
    slightly questions this is he has become
    disruptive in the herd.   This does
    not make sense, but what some see as
    disruptive, I see as normal herd behavior, so
    not sure on this one without more
    details.<br>
    <br>
    Without seeing and working the horse, and
    only getting your view of the situation, it
    is hard to give any other specific course of
    action.</p>

    <p>Question: We  have three mares
    two of which want to be the dominate one. We
    have them separated at home, but one day they
    got in together and had a kick fest, needless
    to say one had to be taken to the vet but was
    ok. We still have them separated but we are
    moving to Oregon and want to put them in
    together when we get there. Does anyone have
    any suggestions for us on a way to do this so
    they don't hurt each other? We have talked to
    several people who train and they say to put
    them in together at our now home and run them
    and then put them into the pasture together.
    My thought is since it will be a new
    place   that they might not be so
    dominant towards each other if they get put
    in together at a new place, since one won't
    be there first. I am afraid of bringing them
    one after the other because then one will
    think it was their home first. Our new
    pasture will be two acres that is wide open
    so they will have plenty of room to get away
    from each other. Our third mare can be in
    with either one of them, so she's not a
    problem</p><br>

    <p>A:   lol, sorry, but I know you
    are not a guy and mean well but you are not
     €˜thinking like a
    horse €™.   Most
    guys would say they will work it out and they
    will get tired of kicking.   Most
    women want to protect, save and get way too
    involved.   All horses kick and all
    bite and all want to be higher.  
    The pecking order keeps order in the
    herd.   These horses are training
    each other, learning from each other, both
    wanting to be lead horse to get the mare and
    both are making each other better and
    stronger, which makes the herd stronger,
    which makes them better survivors, which
    means they will have more lessons and
    knowledge to pass on to their off spring,
    which makes the herd stronger and the cycle
    continues.   All normal horse
    behavior that most humans do not
    understand.   Working the horses
    before you put them together will take some
    of the freshness off them, also putting out
    several small piles of hay (maybe 20 or 30)
    will keep them busy, make sure the piles are
    far enough apart that they have to move to
    get them and they cannot reach each other
    while eating.   This will keep them
    focused on food and not each
    other.   Removing corners from
    fences will help so they
    don €™t get trapped in the
    corner when they fight.   And they
    will fight, it is their nature to move up and
    test leaders.   Once you put them
    out, LEAVE, don €™t stand by
    the gate, ohh €™in and
    awhhh €™in which will create
    a draw and they may come to you which will
    bring them to the fence of gate and increase
    the chance of them getting trapped, cornered
    or hurt.   It looks worse than it
    is, so don €™t
    watch.   People that watch tend to
    want to stop it or help and then they end up
    making it worse and getting a horse hurt or
    separate the horses (which you did) and then
    create more aggression between the horses and
    increase the drive to fight.   Once
    they are together, DON €™T
    feed them in one pile or you will cause them
    to fight, throw hay in several piles to they
    can pick, move, get pushed off and move
    without thinking there is only one pile of
    food and they have to fight to
    eat.   There are two types of
    horses, those who are hurt and those who will
    be hurt.   You can read my
    horsemanship page and it will explain herd
    behavior a little better.</p>

    <p>Question: Since getting my prison trained
    mustang home (Adopted August 2009), he has
    been separate from our other
    horses.   They can smell and touch
    through the panels.   One day, he
    reared up and tried to mount our broodmare
    through the panels.   We pulled her
    apart and put her into pasture for safety
    purposes.  He and our paint mare
    have become such good friends.  
    They are with each other now, and he has
    never been aggressive towards
    her.   We are mixing him with our
    others slowly.   Question
    is:   Now he can't stop mounting
    her.   I know he is gelded, but you
    wouldn't know it.   It is
    literally,   "eat, mount up and
    sleep."   I have heard of this
    happening in the past with some
    geldings.   Has anyone else
    experienced this with their
    horses?   I know he hasn't seen a
    mare in a long time, but wow.  
    :)</p>

    <p>A:   Read the other answer about
    keeping horses together. He could be proud
    cut or have a Cryptorchid (I explain this on
    my horseman tips page: <a href="index.html" target="_blank">www.thinklikeahorse.org</a>) He
    could have been cut late so is still showing
    stud behavior.   The mare will stop
    him when she wants.   He is being a
    horse, if you don €™t
    understand horses, you tend to want to try
    and protect them and save them and then end
    up hurting them or setting them up to
    fail.   Put them together and let
    horses be horse and work things out like
    horses. I guess my question is so what if he
    mounts her?   What is he
    hurting?   And
    don €™t tell me about
    tearing down the fence, if you put them
    together and did not separate them the fence
    would not be an issue. Let them be horses,
    that is what they know and that is what they
    are best at.</p>

  <h3><u><strong>Introducing New Horse to
  Herd:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>  I am a firm believer that a
    horse needs a herd.   A lone horse
    is miserable and develops emotional, mental
    and stress related problems.   I
    would put them both with the herd.
      Even a bottom horse plays a role
    and had a job in a herd.   Every
    herd member is needed and valued in a herd.
      Even if you think the low horse
    only get pushed away, they are needed to keep
    the herd strong and always have a challenger.
      <br>
    <br>
    I say you are never doing a horse a favor by
    isolating him and thinking you are protecting
    or helping him.<br>
    <br>
    Put them in the herd, it will do everybody
    good, the herd will be bigger and feel safer,
    everyone will have a job and you will notice
    a change and see that they are all better for
    it.   It may take a week or two as
    much as a month, but stay out of it and let
    the herd work it out.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page on my site I have a
    section on Herd behavior and it may make it
    clearer.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>He is being a horse that is trying to test
    other horses and see if he can move up in the
    pecking order. The other horses could run
    away or chase him or make him stop if they
    wanted or could stay away from him. If you
    don't know is age, he may be younger, this it
    normally behavior of a younger horse around 4
    or 5ish, but this horse could have been in a
    stall him entire life and does not know how
    to be a horse, how to be in a herd and is
    trying to figure it out.   The herd
    will teach him in time, just let them work it
    out.   A bite here and there and a
    kick here and there, is all normal horse
    stuff.   They are just being
    horses.</p>

    <p>  Deep mud is not good for
    them.   When you say a herd I think
    open area and pasture, not a
    paddock.   If you have 7 or 8
    horses in a small paddock area that can cause
    problems.   This little guy is
    going to have a hard time at
    first.   A herd is tough and does
    not cut slack and does not think emotional,
    everything is done for a reason.  
    You see the strong ones attacking a new
    horse, I see the herd pecking being
    established and reinforced.   As
    long as a horse has a way to get away and
    run, then they will work it out.  
    Normally when horse get get they get trapped
    in a fence corner, they have no where to run
    or it is over food.  </p>

    <p>A good way to introduce new herd members
    it to build a temp round pen in the middle of
    the pasture.   That way the new guy
    and be inside and safe and the rest of the
    herd can come over, visit, push and squeal
    and they can get to know each other a little
    bit before being released.   Two or
    three days in the middle will make the
    transition much easier.</p>

    <p>The key is feeding time, no fence corners
    and room to run. Horse shoes in pasture is
    very dangerous and a leg can get broke so
    that is always a risk.   Another
    option is to take the lead horse in the herd
    and put them together, they will bond in a
    week or so and then when the lead horse goes
    back to herd, he will have bonded with the
    new horse and will protect or at least help
    keep the herd from being to hard on him.</p>

    <p>Walk the new baby by the fence a lot, let
    the other horse come up and sniff and squeal
    and even bite him, he will learn to move and
    show submission, this exposure will help his
    not be such an outsider when you put him in.
      You can even feed him near the
    fence or tie him by the fence and work with
    him, the more exposure the herd sees him and
    is allowed to interact, even through a fence,
    it will be better for him later.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a 17 yr
    old mustang horse and a 3 yr old donkey
    (owned both for 2 yrs) we just last week got
    a 20 yr old pony, we would like advice on how
    to introduce pony into herd? Pony is in their
    pasture but in barn stall, we have taken the
    pony out in evenings into a small paddock we
    put up for him so we can watch interaction
    through fence with each other. My horse being
    the boss in the field has sniffed and left
    for the most part, but today he made 2 (what
    i call bluff charges) at the paddock where
    pony is. The donkey stays at paddock smelling
    and trying to poke his head through fence.
    The pony doesn't react much at all to any of
    this...not even to my horse charging towards
    the fence (my horse did stop charge right at
    fence (bluff charge or showing dominance? )
    Any advice on a safe way to put together and
    how to go about it. Thank you<br>
    <br></p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> feed the pony so
    he is not hungry, then put out 5 or 10 piles
    of hay (half flakes or so each) put these at
    least 20 to 30 feet apart so your two will
    have lots to think about, then let the pony
    in the pasture and you leave and stay out of
    it.   They will work it out.<br>
    <br>
    Anytime you put a new horse in, there is
    always a chance of a kick, cut, bite or fence
    crash, but if you put the hay far apart and
    not close to any fence, the dominant one will
    chase pony off each pile and there will be
    enough piles so no one has to defend any
    food.<br>
    <br>
    they should be fine, don't try and help or
    save, you will make it worse, just give the
    herd something to do (check out all the piles
    of food) and let the pony out that is not
    hungry and they should work it out.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Horse pucky!   Horses don't have
    to big to be in a herd, think about it, that
    would be pretty rough in the wild, if this
    was true all baby horses would be beat up or
    killed, not real good for species.
      The people you ask don't know
    what they are talking about and don't
    understand herd behavior.   If they
    understood they would know that the head
    horse does not care since he knows he is
    lead, he is secure in his position and he
    knows the little guy is no threat.
      The two other young ones are
    fighting for their position and do not want
    to be last, the new guy will be last in the
    pecking order and they have to show him
    that.<br>
    <br>
    I discuss this more on my horsemanship page
    under herd behavior.   Read that
    and if you have more questions, let me
    know.You have learned well, no advice should
    replace your good judgment or your safety.
      I tend to speak for the horse and
    that upsets many people.   This
    colt wants to be part of a herd.
      He is afraid and cannot sleep
    well and has no friends.   He needs
    to be chased to develop his muscles, he needs
    to be pushed to learn respect and that he
    must yield to a higher horse, which will be
    you later.   The herd has to teach
    him herd manners so you can use that
    knowledge later to train him.   I
    am not there, very rarely will a horse beat
    or kill another horse, it can happen, it can
    happen more with stallions.   You
    are correct in the wild the mother will
    protect a colt, but, if a stallion wants the
    horse dead, the mom will be helpless.<br>
    <br>
    We, humans, cause these problems since we buy
    sell, move horses from herd to herd, put up
    fences where horses can get hurt.
      7 acres is pretty good size.
      If this colt gets trapped in a
    corner of a fence (that would not be in the
    wild) he can get hurt.   If he
    panics and runs blindly in fear, he can run
    into or through a fence.   So he
    can get hurt.   In open land he
    would just run and the other would get tired
    of chasing.   The chasing horses
    are just showing dominance and teaching him
    manners, it is not personal, it is not mean,
    it is just horses being horse.
      <br>
    <br>
    You can do a couple of things to ease the
    situation, but I hesitate telling people to
    much since they will do what they think they
    hear or will do it in a vacuum without the
    hundred considerations and variables that
    come into play.   Every thing you
    do depends on several if not a hundred
    different options and variables.
      Each choice changes with many
    factors, the horse €™s
    reaction, the other horses reactions, your
    reactions, the environmental changes, the
    location, etc.     Every
    factor changes what you can do, what you
    should do, what you should not do, how you
    should do, how hard to push, how much to
    release, when to release, when to stop
    releasing, when to stop, when not to stop and
    so on and so on.   So if I say you
    need to do  €œX €
    and you do without any consideration for all
    the other factors then it may not work, if
    may backfire and get you or the horse hurt,
    or you may get lucky and nothing bad happens.
      So when I tell people things,
    they miss all the other stuff and then get
    mad at me when I tell them, It is them that
    causes good or bad, they are the one thing
    that makes a situation work or fail, people
    don €™t want to hear that,
    it is easier to blame the horse for being
    stupid, dumb, or crazy.<br>
    <br>
    You can put up some temporary panels in the
    middle of the pasture and make a round pen or
    box so the colt can hang in there and get to
    sniff and get to know the other guys, they
    can push and have little fights through the
    fence for a day or so and this will make it
    easier when you let him out.<br>
    <br>
    You can take out the most aggressive horse
    and lock him up for a few days and let the
    colt just hang with the leader and one other
    horse, then they can accept him and then let
    the other out, that way the colt will have
    time to learn the fences, learn where he can
    run, learn manners and how to run from the
    other two and then be better prepared to deal
    with the most aggressive horse, when you let
    him back in.   (I say aggressive,
    but I just use that term, this horse is only
    being a horse and making sure his spot in the
    pecking order is maintained, especially if he
    is last, now he is thinking, Yippieeee, now I
    have someone lower to push around).
      <br>
    Another option is lock up the lower horses,
    let the little guy bond and get to know the
    leader and he may take him under his wing and
    protect him from the other two.<br>
    <br>
    Just use imagination and come of with ways to
    set the horses up for success.
      Remember the goal is to get this
    little guy with another horse so he can feel
    safe and start growing and learning herd
    behavior.<br>
    <br>
    I could on and on, but you are there, you
    need to work it out and
    don €™t set the horse (any
    horse) up to fail, help them find the right
    answer.   It will take time and
    effort, but if you rush it, try and take
    short cuts you will make the horse pay for
    your mistakes.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Well you story is too often heard.
      You are why the statistics say
    80% of all new horse owners get out of horses
    in the first year.   You have set
    yourself and your horse up for failure.
      You think since you rode as a kid
    when you had no fear and did not care so much
    that you can do the same thing.
      You can't, you changed and horses
    know it.   You need to learn about
    horse and stop thinking just because you rode
    as a kid that you know horses.
      You don't. Read books, read my
    web site, I bet you will learn many things
    that you never knew as a kid.
      This horse is not dangerous, but
    it may kill you.   That may sound
    silly but it is true.   The horse
    is only a reflection of you.   You
    do not know what you are doing and the horse
    knows it so he is taking advantage of
    you.<br>
    <br>
    I am sure you don't want to hear this, but I
    am telling you like it is.   So
    either admit you don't know what you are
    doing and fix it, learn and study or get out
    of horses before you get hurt and end up
    getting your horse hurt.<br>
    <br>
    If you understood herd behavior you would
    know that ALL horses bite each other and that
    is no reason to keep this horse alone. Put
    the horse out with other horses, stay out of
    it and let the horses be horses.
      They DON'T need you to save them
    or protect them from each other.
      Believe me horse need much more
    protection from people than they do other
    horses.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't believe me, put your horses
    together and leave them alone in 5 days or
    less they will all be buddies and grazing and
    peacefully being a herd.   Try it,
    if you are about to give up anyway what the
    hell.   After you see that I am
    right, then maybe you will listen to what I
    said and finally realize and admit, you do
    not have a horse problem, you have a you
    problem, you are causing your horse to do
    what it is doing, the fact that you do not
    realize this is part of the problem.<br>
    <br>
    Let the horse be a horse and leave him alone
    for a week, read and study everything you can
    get your hands on and then start over.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: A buddy is the best answer, and if
    the only reason you are not doing it is so
    she won't get attached sounds pretty selfish.
      She is a horse that needs a buddy
    to feel safe and secure.   She is
    in the pasture much more time than she is
    with you and for you short periods with her
    you want to deprive her of feeling safe and
    having a friend that understands her.
      People keep horses alone since it
    is easier on them.   I would never
    keep my horse alone.   So what if
    she gets attached, deal with it, it will make
    you better at understanding how to deal with
    and fix problems and keep her focused on you.
      It may be more work, but it is
    best for the horse.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: I do not believe in using
    supplements for behavior problems.
      I am a firm believer that horse
    problems, as people call them, are caused by
    people.   Caused by people that
    don't understand horses.   I say so
    what if she gets attached, because if you
    understood horses you would know that it does
    not matter if a horse is attached, when a
    horse is with a strong leader, it will follow
    that leader and nothing else matters.
      You say you do not have the time
    for another horse, time is the number one
    problem with all horse owners.   To
    me it is an excuse not to put in the effort
    and time to learn and understand horses.
      I have two horses that are
    connected all the time, some would say they
    are buddy sour, it does not matter when I
    take one away they listen to me, since they
    see me a strong and their leader.
      Depriving a horse of a friend is
    selfish, that is my opinion, why should your
    horse be destined to a life of being alone
    because of your lack of time or to prevent
    you from dealing with a normal instinctive
    behavior, being part of a herd.
      Why?   For the same
    reason that most do it, it is easier for
    YOU.<br>
    <br>
    So as your, I would be thinking, lets see, my
    owner wants me to listen to her when she
    decides to come out, but every night I am
    alone, fearful and without a herd, I spend
    all most of my time alone and insecure since
    I do not have a buddy help me stay safe, I
    don't sleep good and I don't rest good, since
    I am alone most of time, then when I am not
    alone, I have this human come out, rush to
    saddle me, ride me, tell me what to do and
    then she leaves me alone, by myself most of
    the time.   Why should I like this
    human, why does she abandon me every night,
    why does she just spend time with me when she
    wants ride me and then leaves me and then she
    expects me to be grateful for some hay and
    treats.<br>
    <br>
    As for trying to fix what you call problems,
    what I call normal horse behavior, with
    supplements, that would be like me telling
    you if someone is hitting you and abusing
    you, you should take some vitamin C.
      This is not about what you feed
    your horse, this is about you having a
    relationship and understanding of your so
    your horse will trust you and see you a fair
    leader that it can trust.   I am
    sure in your mind that you think you treat
    your horse good with good food and give it a
    good home, that is not want a horse wants or
    needs, a horse wants safety and security,
    they only get that from other horse or people
    that understanding and act like other horses.
      Being nice and feeling good about
    yourself means absolutely nothing to a horse.
      <br>
    <br>
    I am pretty sure I could work your horse for
    about 15 minutes, take it for a ride and it
    would not do what it does to you.
      The horse would know I know
    horses and would see me as a safe and
    dependable leader and would act totally
    different with me.   As I always
    say this is not a horse problem, not a
    supplement problem, not a weather problem,
    not a traffic problem, not a barn
    problem...... which leaves People, more
    specifically you.   Fix yourself
    and your horse will get better.
      Stop blaming the horse or looking
    for other solutions, you only have to look in
    the mirror to find the answer.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Helen, like many people who ask me
    questions, the last thing they want to hear
    is they are problem and the want me to tell
    them how to fix the horse.   Anyone
    reading this and if you read again, I never
    said you hit or abuse you horse.
      You hear what you want to hear,
    you see what you want to see.   You
    are still telling me your is stubborn!
      As I say a lot, people that use
    negative terms to describe their horse are
    really describing themselves.   So
    I would from your response that you are
    stubborn and you horse is only a reflection
    of you.   So you are more than
    willing to keep coming up with excuses about
    the poor horse's past, the lack of
    supplements, your horse is sensitive, your
    horse is clever and any other reason.
      You asked for my opinion and I
    gave it to you, nothing you have said has
    changed my opinion and if anything it has
    confirmed it.   You see your horse
    as stubborn, you respond to this by being
    stubborn and then your prediction is proven.
      If I think a horse is mean, I
    treat it mean, it will be mean.
      It I think a horse is abused, I
    spoil it and soon it becomes more spoiled and
    then I use the excuse that it was abused.
      Horses are reflections of the
    people handling them.   A calm
    horse is handled by a calm person, a nervous
    horse is handled by a nervous person, a
    stubborn horse is handled by a stubborn
    person.   <br>
    <br>
    You want to talk about how you saved this
    horse from meat, that is great and good, but
    your horse does not care, does not know it,
    does not appreciate it, does not owe you for
    it or anything else.   A horse does
    not care if you feed it, give it treats or
    keep it warm.   People do get that
    and that is why there so many people blaming
    horses for problems that they create.
      Stop looking for the problem,
    look at yourself, make yourself better and I
    assure you your horse will get better, it is
    really that simple.<br>
    <br>
    So disagree with me, disagree with your
    horse, and keep searching for someone who
    will tell you what you want to hear and maybe
    you will FEEL better, but it will not help
    your horse.   </p>

  <h3><u><strong>Hobbles:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>Hi Sue, hobbles are great tool for
    teaching many things.   In the days
    where your horse was your only means of
    transportation, while traveling long
    distances you would have to sleep where you
    could, many times there were no trees and no
    way to secure your horse.   Hobbles
    allowed you to let your horse graze through
    the night while keeping him close so in the
    morning your horse would not be several miles
    away.   Some horseman use bells on
    a rope tied on their horse to help find them
    after a night of grazing.   By
    putting a bell on the lead horse, you can
    find the herd easier in the morning.
      Hobbles allow a horse to still
    use his back legs for protection and even to
    run if needed, but help minimize his speed of
    travel.   <br>
    <br>
    As for hobble being an advance sack out
    technique, it teaches a horse to trust you
    not to hurt him.   It teaches a
    horse to learn to deal with being trapped or
    restricted without panic.   A
    hobble trained horse will fight less if ever
    trapped in a fence, wire or things that could
    hurt him.   Hobbles, if done right,
    remove fear and teach a horse
    confidence.<br>
    <br>
    I explain this in more detail on my web site,
    read my sacking out section on my
    horsemanship page.</p>

    <p>  This sounds like a exception
    rather than a rule.   You sound
    like you are doing some good things, but they
    are not working.   So looking at
    this from the horse's point of view, why is
    not working?   You have to be
    willing to change if you want to see change
    in your horse.   The horse is
    telling you something, it may be something
    hurts, I am in pain, I don't understand, I am
    confused, I don't know what is going to
    happen....   something is going on
    and the horse is telling trying to tell you.
      Are you listening or you so
    focused on fixing the problem you see that
    you are missing what the horse is saying.
      You say the horse does not like
    to move, you say the horse stands around a
    lot and does not play, then you say the
    sweats and gets wild when you make her move,
    lunge or ride her, so I would look for pain
    or physical issues and make sure her sweating
    and reactions are not from pain.<br>
    <br>
    Then I would try and change what I doing, do
    different things to see if I can get
    different responses.   This horse
    is not a horse anymore since it has been
    ruined, reprogrammed and taught bad lessons
    from bad people.   Sometime this
    can take years to undo, sometime it will
    never get undone and you will only see small
    changes.<br>
    <br>
    Now to contradict what I just said, it sounds
    like you have changed bits, pulleys, gear,
    hacks, and other things.   So maybe
    you did not stick to something long enough to
    get her to adjust and accept
    it.  </p>
    <hr>

    <p>What seem to work best with horses are
    calmness, consistency, routine and lack of
    restraint.   Horses that want to
    run off always do worst when people try and
    hold or force them to stop.   Try
    and stop trying to force her to walk, or to
    stop her from running, focus more on
    redirecting her fear and outburst.
      She has to learn to look to you
    for calmness and security.   When
    she goes off on her instinctual reactions,
    your goal has to be able to pull her back to
    you.   Pull not by force, but by
    understanding.   Not sure how much
    time you are spending with her, but that is
    important, the more time you spend with her,
    not asking or making her do something, the
    more she will not fear or be concerned with
    you, which will make it easier for her to
    look to you when scared or to seek your
    direction.<br>
    <br>
    Not sure I like you keeping her away from
    other horse, if she did good with stud, when
    not in heat I would keep her with him, she
    obviously still understands horses since,
    according to you, he has gotten through to
    her.   Neglected and abused horses
    need recovery time with horses, they need
    time away from humans that just require
    things of them.   I believe this is
    the best healing they can have.<br>
    <br>
    You said she likes being ponied and does
    well, I do as much of that as you can, if you
    do it enough you can probably pony her with
    no lead.   You can teach her to
    follow you and stay with you over time.
      I like to pony out a horse and
    then let off lead on the way home, most
    horses will just follow the other horse home
    and at worst will run home and leave the
    other horse, if it is safe, let her figure it
    out and after a while she will just figure
    out to follow you and you can pony her on all
    rides.   Then you can observe her
    responses with not human interference, no
    reins, no pulling, no rider.. this will help
    confirm that she is not in pain and you can
    get a better indicator on what the horse is
    about, let her grow and experience things
    without being told, forced, pulled,
    pressured.   Over time she will
    figure it out.   The slow way is
    the fast way.   Lots of time, lots
    of small progress, lots of release on all
    tries, all of this seems to work best.<br>
    <br>
    When you lunge or round pen her, don't ask
    for movement, just be with her, let her
    decide to stand or walk, let her decide to
    run or trot, you just see how little you can
    to get her to do something other than stand,
    but standing is OK too.   So change
    what you know, change what has not worked,
    ask less.   When she decides to
    turn up the heat, disengage from her, not
    pressure, release of pressure, start walking
    away, relax and move slowly away, she will be
    confused and will follow and will likely calm
    down, since she is expecting you to put
    pressure by slowing her, speeding her,
    stopping her, since she expects this, don't
    do it, confuse her and make her think, what
    is going on, why is this happening, this has
    never happened before, then you move her out
    of reaction, expectation and get her to think
    and be curious, then she will be thinking and
    not reacting.<br>
    <br>
    This sounds like one of the horses you have
    to think out of the box, she is teaching you.
      She is going to make you better
    and make you use different mental tools in
    your tool box.   The old screw
    driver and pliers will not here, so you have
    to find the new and right tool for her.
      I would be she is used to
    fighting humans, don't fight with her.
      However with that said, how did
    the stud get her to listen or respond.
      If it worked for him, use his
    technique.   Just keep putting
    yourself in your horses position, but
    remember horses don't bribe with carrots and
    treats to get respect, they don't feel sorry
    for a lower horse.   <br>
    <br>
    More turn out time is great and that is one
    thing that you did that has probably helped
    more than you know, so keep her out of that
    stall as much as possible.<br>
    <br>
    hope this helps,</p>

    <p>Comment:   The hobble is
    probably the most dangerous and most
    disrespectful act you can ask a horse to
    engage in. 9 out of 10 horses will be
    seriously injured their first time. Think
    about it...would Monty Roberts or Pat Parelli
    hoble a horse? I think not. This is my
    personal opinion. I've owned horses for 25
    years and only knowï»¿ one guy
    who talked about hobling a horse many, many
    years ago. If you resort to hobling a horse,
    hoble yourself first. Horses are fight or
    flight animals. Hobling a horse is abuse!</p>

    <p>Answer:   You don't understand
    horses or hobbles, hobbles are better than a
    bit/tie down/nails in a hoof.   A
    bit causes pain. OMG, horses are flight
    animals, No shit, If you read my site you
    might truly understand this concept and not
    just repeating what you have
    heard.   Anyone/Monty/Pat knows
    that hobbles are a great way to let your
    horse roam, eat &amp; relax. The stats you
    used that 9 out of 10 only shows the 9 idiots
    that hurt the horse did itï»¿
    wrong.   Horses are hurt everyday
    &amp; some blame the bit, the horse, the
    saddle, the fence &amp; YOU blame the
    hobbles, don't preach ignorance using good
    horseman names to try and impress or give the
    impression that your lack of knowledge is
    somehow improved since you use well know
    horseman's names.   </p>

          <td valign="top">I am not a farrier but
          I do my horses feet myself.
            So I can only give try and
          answer this but there are two or three
          good farriers here on allexperts and
          they could give you better and more
          detailed advice.   If you

          look at them and give you good

          <br>
          The long wet season can make feet soft
          and can cause some mud scald.
            My thoughts on trimming
          feet is LESS is always better.
            It sounds like you may be
          taking off a little much, but without
          seeing the hoof it is hard to tell.
            Also during wet times, move
          hoof comes off with each rasp since the
          hoof is normally moister and softer so
          it is easy to take off too much on a
          soft hoof verses a horse dry
          hoof.<br>
          <br>
          Not trimming them for a month or so
          will not hurt and may give time to grow
          and heal.   I often have a
          farrier take a look at my horse's feet
          to ensure they look balanced and even
          and to make sure I am not missing
          anything.   You may consider
          have a good farrier come out and do a
          trim after a month or so and see what
          they say.<br>
          <br>
          I really recommend that you re-ask this
          question to a farrier expert and get
          their take.</td>

    <p>Your horse looks very sad.   He
    had a good friend and now is alone.
      Horses need another horse to
    relax and to play and so they can rest and
    relax.   Your horse is nervous and
    scared and without another horse to spend
    time with he will get worse.   He
    is also 18 years old so he is set in his ways
    and if he has had bad handling then it will
    take longer to work on those.   I
    would not ride this guy until he was better
    adjusted to his new home and you understand
    horses more.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Hoof cracks could be bad, but I would have
    a farrier take a look at next time one is
    out.   I am pretty anti shoe, but a
    crack that goes all the way to cornet band is
    not good.   This is something that
    needs to be checked out in person, you can
    take a couple of pics and send them I will
    take a look, but depending on how deep is the
    issue, a minor superficial crack may not be
    that bad, but if it is deep through the hoof
    wall, then the hoof strength is definitely
    compromised.   If she is running
    and being active in pasture, then it can't be
    that bad, but remember round penning is very
    tough on horses since it puts lots of weight
    on the outside, too much running a round pen
    does lots of long term damage, I
    think.   I use round pens more for
    control, pressure and release to teach a
    horse I can put pressure and release if it
    the come or follow, it should not be an
    exercise pen, very unnatural and can do more
    damage than the extra weight.</p><br>

  <h3><u><strong>Horse Behavior:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>QUESTION: I'm 52, been around horses much
    of my life, horse has been out on pasture
    with one youger gelding. I bought a big
    quarter horse I would guess he was about 5-6
    when I got him.   Very
    disrespectful,   I have had him two
    years. He got better but not completely was
    treated like a dog not a horse.
      I'm a big guy 6'6" 250 not used
    to loosing in these type of contests.
      He decided he was NOT going ot be
    shod that last time by the farrier.
      I have had back problems and
    can't ride like I used to, can't bend over to
    work on his feet. No round pen although that
    may change.   All the common
    disrespect kind of issues. Not standing still
    while mounting until I have a couple miles on
    him... I read all your comments that I could
    before sending this one and I like your
    responses.   I did send him to the
    Amish to try to get the attitude off him once
    and for all.   I read the opener on
    one you had recommending not to do this but
    was unable to read further.   Now I
    have some concerns about having sent him.
    It's kind of a thing where if I can't get
    this fixed. He's going to be in a lot of
    trouble because I don't sell my problems to
    others and I can't justify keeping him if I
    can't work with him.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Well lots going on here.
      It sounds like this horse has
    been trained well to learn that he is in
    charge, he is bigger, he is stronger and he
    gets his way... all bad lessons to teach a
    horse.   So now the horse has
    become the teacher and he is teaching well.
      It sounds like he has taught you
    that you can't win, not true, but if you
    believe it, then it is so.   It you
    believe you can or believe you can't, you are
    probably right!<br>
    <br>
    Older Men horse owners tend to be too
    aggressive, much like most women tend to be
    too nice and think love will make a horse
    better.   All discipline and no
    love is just as bad as all love and no
    discipline.   Both confuse the
    horse.   <br>
    <br>
    In my younger days, growing up in Texas, it
    was all about showing the horse who is boss,
    and that worked, when you are young, strong
    and in good health, but later in life, it
    does not work so well as you are finding out.
      I hear a lot about this horse,
    but not too much about you.   Being
    around horses and owning horses does not mean
    you understand horses.   I say this
    since I was around horses for years and did
    not have a clue.   Natural
    Horsemanship works, it works better and is
    easier on horse and human.
      However, unless you think like a
    horse, understand a horse's mind,
    understanding a horse's instincts,
    understanding that Release teaches, know
    about feel and timing, know about pressure
    and release, advance and retreat, knowing
    about herd behavior, knowing how horses talk
    and communicate with each other, know what
    you are saying with your body and actions,
    all these things make you successful or
    unsuccessful with horses.<br>
    <br>
    You are still seeing this as a horse problem,
    I tell you and just about everybody,
    including myself, whatever a horse does you
    cause it, you either cause good behavior or
    bad behavior, to a horse it is just behavior.
      <br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page, it will make you
    see there is a lot about a horse you do not
    know.   Once you accept that you
    are the problem and if you change your horse
    will change, then you will see progress.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>A horse is give and take, if you just take
    the horse will stop giving, if you just give
    the horse will take more and more.
      It has to be a partnership.
      The Amish do not believe this,
    they normally believe that pain, meanness,
    threats and intimidation all bad since they
    do not understand release, or having a
    relationship with a horse, they only
    understand dominance and fear.
      Maybe not all, but most that I
    know of.<br>
    <br>
    Work on yourself and your horse will get
    better.   This horse is teaching
    you, this horse is forcing you to learn, it
    is not going to let you get away with the old
    brute force training methods, this horse is
    going to make you understand horses and learn
    their language if you want to Win......
      Calm seas never made a good
    sailor and easy horses never made a good
    horseman.<br>
    <br>
    As for you not wanting to pass on your
    problems, you are the problem not the horse,
    in another hands, this horse could be a gem..
    don't make this a horse problem, this horse
    needs change, either change in you, change to
    someone else or change in how it is
    treated.<br>
    <br>
    Horses are masters of change.. they adapt
    almost too well, whenever something changes
    they know it and they change and they adapt.
      You have a great horse here that
    is tying to force you to be better, don't
    sell him short or yourself, read, try
    different things and grow with this horse
    instead of fighting and allowing him to lead
    you down the path of failure.<br>
    <br>
    The short answer is, move a horses feet to
    show him you are higher.   Stop
    him, move him, change his direction, change
    is speed, make him back up, all of this tells
    him you are higher and he should not
    challenge you.<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps,<br>

    QUESTION: You are correct sir, an old dog can
    learn new tricks if the old dog doesn't let
    old pride interfere. Thank You for your
    prompt response<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> Thank
    you.. I must say it is refreshing to have
    someone listen to my suggestions and not take
    personal and tell me how rude I am to even
    suggest that it may be their fault.<br>
    <br>
    Horses make us better, they challenge us,
    they force us to be on our A game or they
    take over, it is their way.   They
    are always trying to find weakness in their
    leader since their life depends on it.
      They are always on their A game
    or they are dead.   Horses are not
    mean they are direct, they are not ego driven
    they are staying alive driven.
      Their entire life is about being
    a part of a social herd where numbers mean
    safety and having only the strongest and
    smartest leader keeps them alive.
      Success to a horse is not about
    impressing others, being right or other petty
    human traits, it is about staying alive.
      They are the purest form of
    survival of the fittest.   All too
    often people want to make them better,
    improve them, or help them......
      they do not need our help or
    improvement, they are pretty prefect as they
    are... but as humans, with our egos and self
    importance, we always want to make it their
    problem...   It just ain't so and
    once people get that, they are on their way
    to true horsemanship.<br>
    <br>
    Best to both of you,</p>

          <strong>Question:</strong></td>

          <td valign="top">QUESTION: I acquired
          an 8 year old Arabian Gelding that has
          been previously ridden only in arena
          and paddock or small field settings. He
          is very "Arabian" in that he is
          sensitive and reactive but also
          wonderfully responsive. He is sound,
          healthy, on daily turnout with 2 other
          horses and close to many others. He is
          stalled for 4 to 8 hours each day with
          pelleted feed and hay. He has had some
          professional training for the show ring
          but when I bought him, I was told he
          wasn't happy in the show ring. I am a
          trail rider. I have moderate experience
          riding trail and have done some long
          distance rides. I cannot get this horse
          desensitized to the trails. He spooks
          dangerously at anything that he cannot
          see. I can lead him and he's fine.
          Mounted he is dangerous. He rears,
          spins, bolts and hops. I have had
          broken bones as a result. He might be
          fine and confident one day with a quiet
          horse companion then the next day be
          frantically nervous. He will cross
          water one day and the next act like
          he's never seen the same creek. He is
          responsive, respectful and confident in
          an arena setting or in hand. I have
          gone so very very slow with his trail
          training but cannot get him accustomed
          to it. It has been nearly a year. He
          will, without warning, spook at a sound
          or site that is something he's seen or
          heard before without warning and he's
          very light on his front end. I once
          enjoyed his challenges, he's a dream to
          ride and I like animated horses but
          this feels like he becomes unhinged and
          there's no way to ground him and
          reassure him once he is anxious. Any
          tips beyond the "you need to
          desensitize him" or "give it time"
          would be appreciated. I am surrounded
          by experienced riders who have not been
          able to tell me how to handle him. I
          don't want to give up on him.<br>

          ANSWER: I always look to people for the
          problem and not the horse.
            You may be too nice and too
          easy and he knows it.   This
          is a smart horse, you think he is not
          learning, I think is learning too well.
            He knows your weakness and
          is using them.   Sacking out
          is different than just desensitizing
          him.   Read my sacking out
          section on my horsemanship page.
            Show and teach this horse
          you can create fear and remove it, you
          can make him nervous and uncomfortable
          and can make him feel safe, this horse
          will get his confidence from you, but
          you must first have it.   If
          he is so good on ground then find
          things that scare him and stop his fear
          and put him to work and make his
          attention go away from fear and back to
          you.<br>
          <br>
          Time will teach you, a horse knows how
          to be a horse.   My guess is
          that this horse does not run around the
          pasture scared all the time when you
          are not riding him or with him, that is
          a good sign that you are doing
          something to cause this or not doing
          enough to prevent it.
            <br>
          <br>
          Read my site so you understand horses
          better and turn up the heat on this
          horse and show him you are a strong
          leader that will not allow him to be
          fearful.<br>

          QUESTION: I've read a number of your
          articles on your site including the
          sacking out part. I watched the video.
          As I said before he does not react in a
          bad way to stimulus in hand and is calm
          when being led, tied and handled. It's
          only under saddle and on the trail that
          he becomes fearful.   I ride
          other horses, some young and learning
          and I don't have a problem with them
          even when they are fearful or spooky. I
          agree that his is a confidence problem
          and that he'll get confidence from me
          but when he becomes unhinged, exactly
          HOW do I "stop his fear"? When he is
          experiencing snorting, shaking, head
          up, heart pounding fear reaction do you
          think he is "using my weaknesses"? I
          wish I knew more about all the
          skeletons in his closet. I think I know
          that time is my answer, I just hope he
          doesn't hurt me in the meantime. Thanks
          for your help, this is a really
          valuable service!<br>

          <td valign="top">
            You cannot stop his fear, part of the
            problem is you think you can, you try
            and you fail.   All horses
            identify weaknesses in people and
            other horses.   He is found
            many in you.   He knows he
            can get you off, he knows you get
            scared when he gets scared, he knows
            you will not correct or discipline
            him for reacting the way he does to
            his fear, he knows you do not help
            him with his fear with strong
            direction and instead try and talk
            and calm him.   YOU DO NOT
            UNDERSTAND HORSES.   You
            think since you can ride other horses
            with no problems then this must be a
            horse problem.   You want
            to worry about his skeletons and
            think that somehow you can fix or
            make it better by knowing what he has
            been through.   I think you
            are wrong.   YOU hope he
            does not hurt you, he does not care
            what you hope, he does not care if he
            hurts you and he does not care that
            love him and take care of him, he is
            a horse and that is all he knows how
            to be.   YOU can't admit
            that you are the problem, you can't
            help this horse since you don't
            understand horses, you don't want to
            get hurt, but you don't know how to
            increase your chances of not getting
            hurt.   You are looking at
            this from your emotions and not for
            logic.<br>
            <br>
            This horse does not want to hurt you,
            he does not want to hurt himself, but
            he will do both to try and stay
            alive.   You see his fear
            as a problem, he sees it as a way to
            stay alive, since you look at this
            from a you and human side and he
            looks at this as a horse and stay
            alive side, your chances of
            succeeding are less and your chances
            of getting you or the horse hurt is
            more.<br>
            <br>
            Reading a few articles, watching a
            few videos, riding a few horses, do
            not teach you about horses.
              Horses are the best
            teacher of horses.   You
            don't know it but this horse is
            making you better, he is making you
            more aware, he is making you have a
            better seat, he is building your
            confidence, he is forcing you to grow
            and try and learn different ways, but
            with horses the lessons are dangerous
            and unforgiving.   <br>
            <br>
            Stop thinking the horse has a problem
            and work on yourself, then your horse
            will get better.   Stop
            thinking you got have this figured
            out, you don't, you don't understand
            horse fear, you don't understand how
            to remove fear, you don't understand
            how to teach a horse to respond
            differently to his fear.
              I know this since the
            horse is telling you this.
              The horse will tell you
            when you are right and when you are
            wrong.   Problem is most
            people are too busy being right to
            listen, they are too busy helping,
            they are too busy trying to fix the
            horse.<br>
            <br>
            I work with horses all the time where
            people tell me how special their
            horse is, how different their horse
            is, how what a troubled past their
            horse has had and each and every time
            the horse does fine when I work with
            it.   So you would think
            the people would get that they are
            the problem and not the
            horse............Nope, they end up
            wanting to give me the horse or tell
            me what a gift I have, or how I have
            a special way with horses or their
            horse must be a Man's horse.
              None of what is true, I
            understand horses, I know horses, I
            listen to horse and I know that a
            horse is only the reflection of who
            is handling it and that I cause all
            things that happen when I handle a
            horse.   If a horse does
            good, I cause it, if it does bad,
            gives me the wrong answer, get hurts
            or confused, I CAUSED IT.
              Most people never get
            this and that is why horse traders,
            trainers and others make lots of
            money off lots of people.<br>
            <br>
            Work on yourself and your horse will
            get better.

          <td valign="top">
            <p>Well, I don't think you are going
            to like my answer, but I have gotten
            used to it, so here I go.
              :)   This is
            not a horse problem.   You
            are looking at this like the horse
            planned to hurt you or planned to run
            back or is so smart that it knows
            what it is doing, all wrong in my
            book.   This horse is being
            a horse and part of the problem is
            you don't see this or understand it.
              This horse telling you,
            screw off, you are not a good leader,
            you don't have my respect, you can't
            stop me, you can't make me not want
            to do this and the big pay off for
            the horse is, IT GETS RELEASE!
              --   I just did
            an article on release and the link is
            below.<br>
            <br>
            You see this as the horse has a
            habit, I see it as you created the
            habit by not stopping it.
              You say the horse bolts,
            I say you let the horse bolt and you
            do not stop it from bolting.
              You say you got hurt from
            her bad habit, I say you got hurt
            since you did not see it coming, you
            allowed it to happen and you did not
            stop it.   You say the
            horse want to get to rail or buddy, I
            say the knows it can where where he
            wants, so it does.   This
            is why I always say it is never the
            horse's fault and most horse problems
            are people problems.<br>
            <br>
            I assure you, if I got on this horse
            it would not run back to rail.
              For the simple reason
            that I would not allow it, I would
            make this horse not want to go to
            rail, I would make it work and not
            fun to be at the rail, I would run
            this horse around the rail 20 times
            until the horse was begging me to
            stop, I would know how to flex this
            horse and disengage his rear end so
            he could not run where he wanted to,
            I would make sure this horse knows
            that I am ready and just waiting for
            him to run so I could put him to
            work, I would be prepared and ready
            to prevent this horse from running, I
            would make sure this horse knows when
            I say whoa it mean whoa, I would
            teach this horse that I am in control
            and he is not in control, I would
            know that this horse shows me respect
            or pays for not showing me respect.
              Everything a horse does
            is because of what we do, what we
            allow, what we fail to prevent or
            what happens because we are not
            paying attention and missed the
            signs.<br>
            <br>
            I call this a good horse.
              He has payed attention,
            he has leaned from you well, he has
            proven to you and him that he is
            smarter so he is leader, so he is
            higher and he his in charge.
              You and I know this is
            not true, he is not smarter, but you
            have allowed him to think this and he
            has convinced you of this, now you
            believe and that is why you are
            writing me.   You are
            smarter, you can stop this, you can
            prevent this, you can change this,
            which is why this is a people problem
            and not a horse problem.<br>
            <br>
            Read my horsemanship page on my site
            it is long, but it will help you
            understand horses better and maybe
            help you understand what is going on

            <p>I have a 17.2hh TB gelding who is
            11yrs old who was normally very quiet
            but I had a bad accident while
            jumping one of my old horses and am
            just trying to get back into riding
            and over my fear. I have only had
            darcy for just over a week and have
            not been able to ride due to weather
            conditions and the fact he has
            recently thrown a shoe. I had him
            cleared of any problems or drugs by a
            vet and when i rode him pre purchase
            he was perfect but he is now becoming
            very aggressive and piggish when i
            handle him on the ground and it is
            making me uneasy about riding him.
            his feed is all cool mixes and low
            energy as he is not work at the
            moment what could be causing this
            change in temperament and what can i
            do to regain control and respect. I
            love him very much and he is just so
            beautiful he is a stunning mover and
            i want to be able to have a good
            partnership with my boy.<br>

            ANSWER: Fear is a bad thing with
            horses.   Horse's know what
            is going to happen before it happens.
              They know if you are
            worried or fearful, they can read it
            and they will take advantage of it.
              This horse was good
            before since it did not know you, if
            did not know that you were insecure,
            it did not know that you were scared
            to get tough.. Now it does, you have
            taught it so and now that it knows
            this, you have to un-teach it.
              This is near impossible
            since you caused it in the first
            place.   Loving this horse
            will not help this horse.
              Being tough, showing it
            who is boss, being a strong leader,
            being clear that this horse MUST
            respect you or you will take charge
            and move it feet and show the horse
            that you are a strong and capable
            leader.   You have not
            shown this and the horse knows!<br>
            <br>
            Trying to get over fear by trial and
            error only confuses the and makes it
            more likely that you will get hurt.
              You create what you fear
            with horses.   Horses are
            only a reflection of the person
            handling them.<br>
            <br>
            Read my site and learn as much about
            horses since sometime knowledge is
            power and it will help you with your
            fear.<br>
            <br>
            Horses keep you honest, you cannot
            fool a horse into thinking you are a
            good leader that is not scared or
            worried, they will read right through
            it and then not respect you or trust
            you.   I always hear,
            mostly women, say my horse loves me,
            he knows I love him.....
              horse pucky, a horse
            likes a strong leader, they only
            respect a higher horse, higher horses
            are rarely nice, offing treats, head
            horses and lead horses are direct,
            they are sure of themselves and they
            will not hesitate to correct a lower
            horse if it does not listen.
              Either learn to be a
            higher horse is expect this treatment
            from every horse you ever have.<br>

            QUESTION: Firstly i live in
            queensland aus and my fall i had left
            me in wheel chair for almost 2 years
            so i think i have every reason to be
            nervous since it was jumping at a
            state comp that put me in it. I have
            owned 12 horses including a beautiful
            arab stallion and mare who i bred a
            few times and i also work at a arab
            stud on weekends and as vet nurse
            with a major in equine injury during
            the rest of my time a manage a pet
            superstore. second Now i paid a great
            deal of money for this horse because
            he would be sumthing that i could put
            effort into and get bk to competing
            the fact is he is really big and YES
            i am NERVOUS FROM ALMOST BEING
            KILLED.   It was neither my
            fault or my horses it was number of
            things that contributed.AND you have
            to start over coming the fear and
            moving on anyway so in your opinion i
            clearly should not owna horse or ride
            anymore BUT i can tell you that is
            not an option I was good at what I
            did and want to be that good again
            BUT i know its going to take time. I
            asked for advise on how i can go
            about moving past my fear and regain
            control not for you to tell me " a
            horse is only as good as it handler"
            you didn know me or what my situation
            really was u have not seen me ride so
            how could u judge me like that. this
            question and the other are on public
            view so ther ppl wanting advise know
            they arn't going to get any
            here.<br>
               <strong>Answer:</strong>
            You asked a question and asked for my
            opinion.   Now you don't
            like the answer and now want to make
            this about YOU.   You used
            "I" about 15 times in your follow up,
            you are more worried about how you
            look and are trying to tell me how
            much you know and how much you used
            to do and how good you are and how
            you want help but obviously not
            honest help.   I don't do
            this to make YOU feel good or to tell
            you what you want to hear, you can
            pay a trainer for that.   I
            understand horses and try and help
            horses.   You are scared,
            frankly I don't care if you have good
            reason to be scared or if you are
            scared for no reason, the fact is you
            are scared and horses know it.
              So because of that fear,
            you change how you act and what you
            do since you are scared.
              Horses know what is going
            to happen before it happens, they
            don't miss anything, so when they are
            handled by people who are scared,
            they know it, and they don't care
            why, they see it as weakness, they
            don't respect it, they are smart
            enough not to trust their life to
            someone who is weak or scared, so
            they resist more, they test more,
            they challenge more, they react more,
            their fear and flight instinct is
            more and all this creates a good
            combination for confusion, fear, lack
            of trust and lack of respect.
              <br>
            <br>
            So you keep giving me your resume and
            telling me and others how good you
            are.   It makes no
            difference to me or to horses.
              You are looking for
            answers to YOUR problems with your
            horse, I am telling what I believe is
            the cause and since it hurts your
            feelings or your ego, you want to
            make it about me, my answer or
            something other than YOU.<br>
            <br>
            I am doing you and your horse a favor
            and you are too concerned about how
            you look or how you may be seen to
            look at my opinion objectively.<br>
            <br>
            So feel free to ask someone else for
            the answer you want to hear. You got
            my answer.   Perhaps you
            should show your horse your resume
            and what you have done in the past
            and that will fix your
            problems.<br>
            <br>
            Good day!</p><br>

            First I would say you need to not
            call your horse names.
              Your horse is only a
            horse and any bad habits or negative
            behaviors have been taught to him by
            PEOPLE.   If you came off a
            race track you would not be happy
            either, handled every day by people
            that care about you, all they do is
            take you out of a stall run the crap
            out of you, put you on a hot walker,
            put you back in the stall and feed
            you high rich energy food and then
            keep you locked up until they want to
            run the crap out of you the next
            day.... not much a life for anyone,
            especially a horse, so cut him some
            slack.<br>

            <p><br>
            You said your self that he does
            better when left in pasture with his
            buddies.   Of course he
            does, horses hate stalls, they hate
            being locked up, and they have lots
            of energy that needs to be let off
            and they can't do it in a stall.
              That will fix most of
            this.<br>
            <br>
            The other thing is he is biting and
            pinning and kicking all are dominance
            issues that should not be allowed.
              You have to impress this
            horse that you are a leader and you
            will not allow that.   You
            do that by first not locking him up,
            then being a good leader, spending
            time with him not working him, take
            him for walks and grazing, and if he
            shows any disrespect you have to let
            him know that you can move his feet,
            back him up, make him move, disengage
            his hips and other things that make
            him submit and tells him you are boss
            and he does not do those things.</p>

            <p>  ANSWER: It may be
            teeth, but I don't think so.
              I think this horse like
            most horses do not like barrel
            racing.   Running barrels
            is hard on a horse, they normally get
            kicked to go faster, they get their
            mouth yanked on to make them turn
            faster and they learn very quick to
            associate barrels with pain and work.
              When people say My horse
            loves, that normally means they love
            it and then want to see their horse
            love it.   I have never met
            a horse that loved barrel racing.
              What they love is to do
            as fast as they can so the rider will
            get off and leave them alone.
              <br>
            <br>
            It sounds more like she is sour to
            racing, like a lot of barrel racing
            horses do.   This is not
            uncommon and pretty predictable.
              I can assure you when you
            barrel race you are not working of
            soft contact, you are not working on
            good communication with your horse,
            you are not taking things slowly and
            working with your horse and
            considering what your horse is
            feeling or what your horse is going
            through.   You are worried
            about getting a good time, finishing
            fast and looking good... none of that
            means anything to your horse.<br>
            <br>
            That is my take,<br>

            QUESTION: I know my horse likes
            barrel racing. I have a personal
            trainer who says my mare does like
            barrel racing. Her ears are pricked
            and he says her eyes are happy when
            she runs. I don't yank her around the
            barrel, I have a video and I can
            prove it. She is not in pain. I take
            care of my horse perfectly. I am not
            worried about looking good. And my
            mare is just getting trained. I am
            not worried about speed right now, so
            thats not the problem. She is not
            sour, cause I only barrel race her 3
            times a week at the walk and jog! My
            horse comes running to me when I go
            outside, until recently, and that was
            why I messaged you, to see what was
            wrong. I think you are wrong about
            barrel racing, lots of horses love
            it. And I can assure you, I am
            working on a soft contact, and I am
            going slowly and have good
            communication. And of course I
            consider what my horse is feeling and
            going through. I don't know if you
            meant to or not, but you imsulted me,
            barrel riders, their horses, and this
            sport with your message.<br>
               <strong>Answer:</strong>
            If you want to feel insulted, I can
            not help that.   You asked
            my opinion and from what you told me
            I gave my best guess.   I
            may be wrong. It my answer does not
            apply to you then fine, ignore it.
              It amazes me when people
            ask my opinion and as soon as I even
            slightly suggest that it may be them
            causing the problem, then all of a
            sudden they want to tell me how wrong
            I am.   It does not matter
            to me what you think, the fact is
            your horse is giving signals when
            around the barrels so if it is not
            what I said, then you need to figure
            out what it is.   Perhaps
            your trainer, who probably gets paid
            to tell you things that make you feel
            good and that won't upset you.
              I can tell from your
            response that you would not pay me
            since you don't want to be told you
            may be the problem.   So if
            I wanted to get paid by you, and did
            not care about anything else, then I
            would tell you what you wanted to
            hear so you would keep paying
            me.<br>
            <br>
            By the way, if you have a trainer and
            you obviously like and agree with
            this trainer since you want to quote
            him,   why are asking me
            this question when a trainer, who
            knows and sees the horse SHOULD be
            much more qualified to answer
            this?<br>
            <br>
            In order not to get an email back
            from you telling how wrong I am, I
            will give you an answer that you like
            better.<br>
            <br>
            It sounds like you have done a really
            good job with this horse, since it
            loves it's barrels so much it can't
            be that, so from what you told me it,
            it may be medical, I would suggest
            you check with you vet and have a
            complete check up to rule out medical
            problems.   Once you do
            that find a qualified trainer so the
            horse can be evaluated in person.
              Thanks so much for your
            question, I hope it works out for you
            and your horse.</p>
            <hr>

            <p><strong>Question:</strong> I am 35
            yrs old with very little experience
            with horses however my friend has
            experience with them and is teaching
            me how to train my horse which is 3
            yrs old.   I keep her at my
            friends place and she brought home 2
            Morgans mid winter this year...until
            then my horse had been by
            herself....now she is what my friend
            calls herd bound...she cannot bear to
            be away from the 2 which do not like
            her at all...she lost her baby at 5
            months due to the gelding kicking
            her.   so we have to keep
            them separated now since they tried
            to run her through the barbed
            fence...inside the small barn they
            are kept tied in straight stall
            fashion (we are working on getting
            the bigger barn built which will have
            separate stalls)   opk the
            problems are - herd bound how do we
            fix this?, acts up and strikes out
            when my friend goes to take her out
            of the barn after the other 2 were
            let out...from what we can tell she
            was led around with kids on her back
            ...she leads ok but when you get in
            the saddle and try to get her to step
            out she "explodes" according to my
            friend...I have yet to see it happen
            though so I am not sure....I have
            seen the others and when I have
            handled her also she has acted up
            occasionally but I noticed
              not as much
              as when my friend is
            around....I understand that she is
            young and will try to get away with
            things but we have to get her over
            the herd bound thing and striking out
            to get her own way...that can be
            dangerous...I don't want her spirit
            broke but at the same time I need a
            horse that isn't dangerous....I have
            worked with her myself and haven't
            had much of a problem, every chance I
            get I work with her so I don't think
            I am the problem because she responds
            to me and I don't use whips
              and such....please let me
            know what you think ...I would
            appreciate it greatly.<br>
               <strong>Answer:</strong>
            All horses are dangerous and are more
            dangerous with people that know know
            what they are doing.   All
            horses are herd bound, it is how they
            stay alive.   If you
            understood horses you would know a
            horse cannot relax, feel safe or
            relax when alone and not with other
            horses.<br>
            <br>
            Your problems with this horse is not
            the horse, you need to educate
            yourself on horses, learn all you can
            so you understand them.
              One thing is true in the
            horse world, everyone that owns
            horses thinks they know horses, the
            reality is buy a horse is easy, hell
            you don't even need a license.
              Anyone can own a horse
            for their entire life, it does not
            mean they know or understand
            horses.<br>
            <br>
            Read my web site, it will help you
            see horses differently.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>ANSWER: Of course she is fixable.
              She is not broke, she is
            just a horse.   All horse
            bite and all get bit, that is how
            they show dominance and try and move
            up in the herd.   You took
            her out, stopper her from eating, she
            did not know you much less respect
            you, so she told you so the only way
            she know how.   You
            continued to make this about the
            horse, you say you couldn't catch
            her, I say you did not know how to
            catch her and now you have learned
            how to catch her.   You say
            she is difficult, she is just a horse
            looking for answers.   You
            say the training techniques that you
            learn at clinics don't seem to apply
            to her.   MAYBE, you are
            not doing the techniques rights,
            maybe your timing is off, maybe your
            feel is not developed, maybe you
            don't have the experience of working
            with 100's or 1000's of horses that
            the people that taught the clinics
            did.   I worked with lots
            of people and horses and 99% of the
            time it is the person causing the
            problems.   They read
            books, watch dvds, go to clinics and
            then never work with tough or
            difficult horses.   They
            always seek and want the easy horses,
            the ones that listen and require less
            work, so they never really understand
            a horse, they never work through the
            problems and just quit or move on or
            sell the horse and mostly just blame
            the for being stubborn, stupid, crazy
            or some other name.   I
            have encountered lots of horses that
            nothing seems to work but I have to
            keep trying, I have to try and see
            what I doing wrong, if what I am
            doing is not working then I am doing
            it wrong.   A good
            horseperson will always look to what
            they are doing and never blame the
            horse.   You don't know it,
            but his horse is being a great
            teacher, she is not going to work for
            just anyone, she is not going to
            allow just anyone to follow, she is
            going to make sure you really want
            it, you are really dedicated and will
            not give up on her.   She
            is where she is since many people
            have quit on her, blamed her, and
            make it all her fault.   So
            she has learned well from all the
            people that left her.</p>

            <p>ANSWER: OK Carol, this horse's
            behavior is caused by you.
              Until you accept this as
            fact you can not fix it.
              If you think it is the
            horse, the new area, the age, the
            prior handling, the breed, the long
            walk, then YOU cannot fix this.
              You have to acknowledge
            that you are causing this since you
            are not stopping or preventing it.
              This horse is convinced
            that you can't control her, you don't
            trust her, you are not secure or safe
            when you are with her.
              She knows this and I know
            this, so until you accept this, her
            behavior will continue.
              <br>
            <br>
            You can go about this in different
            ways, many would tell you to "show
            her who is boss", but what does that
            mean.   To and the horse is
            means she has to see you as smarter
            and as her leader, she does not see
            as that now, since you are not
            smarter, you have told her so by
            letting her do all this.
              She is not being mean or
            bad, she is being a horse and acting
            like a horse without a leader.
              Of course she is excited
            to get out to pasture, you would be
            too if you were locked up all night.
              So, you need to
            understand this and try and get her
            to pay more attention to you, to see
            you as her leader and that you will
            not allow her to do these things that
            could hurt you.   If you
            are so convinced that she wants to go
            to pasture, then walk her out of barn
            and let her go.   She will
            run to pasture gate and wait for you,
            problem solved.   No
            fighting, not frustration and you and
            the horse prefer it.   Now
            lots of people are too afraid to do
            this, think the horse will run off
            and leave, or will get hurt or they
            will never be able to catch the horse
            again.   All not true, but
            most people will not listen, will not
            believe and will not try it.
              So that is one fix.
              Another fix is carry some
            carrots and feed her small pieces on
            the way to the barn, that will help
            keep her attention on you and she
            will not be so focused on the gate.
              You can probably do this
            with the horse off lead and free, she
            will follow you and want to walk with
            you since you have carrots.
              Another way is to beat
            the horse, correct it, hit it back it
            up, whip it and make it scared of you
            so it will not pull.   All
            are options, but the best way for you
            and the horse is for you to work on
            yourself.<br>
            <br>
            You need to control this horse with
            your brain and not your muscle, you
            need to stay calm and in control, you
            need to push this horse back when she
            pushes, when she rears, you need to
            go after her butt and make her
            disengage her hips and face you, when
            she passes you, you need to back her
            up and stop her, when she tries to
            run off to the gate, you need to make
            her face you and walk her backwards,
            make her back up to the gate.
              She will get good at her
            back up and she can't go as fast.
              All of this will tell and
            show this horse that you are in
            charge, you control her feet, you are
            higher in the herd, she needs to pay
            attention to you and not the gate or
            pasture.   This horse will
            you a better horse person.
              She is reading you right,
            she knows you don't know, she knows
            you are not stopping her, she knows
            she can do what she is doing, YOU let
            her.<br>
            <br>
            This is an easy fix, but YOU have
            accept that you are the problem and
            not the horse.</p>

            <p>Hi Tricia, this is odd. I would
            not sell the horse, if anything give
            him away to a great home, but not
            yet.   This horse may be
            very connected to you and see's these
            others as competition to his herd of
            you and him.   Regardless
            of the reason, he should not be doing
            this.   You said you have
            not been spending much time as you
            did, horses know this and get sour
            for being abandoned and left on his
            on.   I would guess these
            other people do not spend time with
            the horse either so he has no reason
            to accept them other then his respect
            for you.   If you are
            really seen as the leader, then he
            should not do this if you correct him
            or tell him to stop, however, if you
            two are pretty equal and he thinks
            you are not the clear leader, then he
            will want to protect you and keep you
            for him, that tells me he sees you as
            his herd and not as you being the
            leader.   <br>
            <br>
            There are lots of fixes, keep the
            others away from him or tell them to
            deal with him like you, they don't
            want a relationship with him or don't
            want to take the time with the horse,
            so don't blame him for being bad.
              As for the farrier and
            vet, that could be from past
            experiences or from you not being a
            clear leader.<br>
            <br>
            People tend to see the problem
            different than it is when it comes to
            horses.   This is not a
            horse problem, it is a you problem or
            a vet problem or farrier problem,
            this horse is only being a horse and
            will do what it has to do, if no one
            is giving it clear direction on what
            is accepted, then you can't blame him
            for doing it no more than you can
            blame a child for running into
            traffic if no one has never taught
            the child that traffic is
            dangerous.</p>

            <p>Ignore her resistance.
              Make her move, stay
            focused on what you want, move her
            feet, and don't get distracted by her
            test (tail, squeal, threats)
              any threats to kick, bite
            or strike, needs to be corrected with
            harsh discipline.   That is
            a no no and she needs to know it hard
            and fast.   A minor kick
            out and buck is not bad, but if she
            tries to kick or spins her butt and
            backs to you, hit her with a rope,
            stick or anything you can on the butt
            "as hard as you can", do not be easy,
            do not be soft, it needs to scare the
            S*#*# out of her and she will not do
            it again.<br>
            <br>
            Read my horsemanship page it will
            help you understand horses better to
            see what this horse is doing, she is
            just testing you to see if she can
            bully you into not making her work,
            she is trying to see if you are
            really the leader and really strong
            enough to be her leader, if you pass
            the test and don't back down, then
            she will stop testing, if you are
            unsure and don't continue to make her
            listen then she will see you as weak
            and will continue to test
            you.  </p>
            <hr>

            <p>First, you need to be with your
            horse more during this time so you
            can see it for your self.
              If my horse is "going
            crazy"   I would be there
            to see it.   You call it
            tantrums, maybe your horse is scared,
            maybe she is going night blindness,
            maybe someone is doing something to
            cause this, maybe she is in pain from
            an internal issue.   What
            ever it is, if it was my horse I
            would be there.   <br>
            <br>
            As for a possible cause, dusk is the
            worst time for a horse.
              Their eyes can take up to
            30 mins for them to adjust to night
            or darkness.   That is why
            horse have so much problems with dark
            or low light trailers, they can't see
            and it all appears pitch black.
              So my first guess would
            be that your horse may be going
            blink, having eye sight issues or
            something else related to the low
            light of dusk.<br>
            <br>
            Be there for your horse, call a vet,
            confirm what is going on and help
            your horse.   Wondering,
            guessing and waiting does not help
            your horse.</p>

            <p>Since the problem just started
            either you caused it or others are
            lying to you and not telling you
            problem. Since I cannot see you ride
            and did not see the ridden before
            you, there is no way for me to know.
              Circling a horse is
            always the best response and most
            times will only agitate and make the
            horse more nervous.
              People who circle a horse
            are normally nervous, insecure and
            don't know any better.   It
            will slow a horse, it will help a
            horse from running away, but is not a
            real training method, it is a stall
            or pause so you can get the horse to
            come back to you.   The
            horse has to learn that doing this is
            more work than not doing it, so he
            will not want to do it.
              This behavior is either
            fear based or lack of respect based.
              You need to determine
            this in order to know how to address
            it.   Fear based can not be
            handled with more pressure.
              See my sacking out
            section on my site.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Ground work and making the horse
            respect you may or may not help your
            daughter.     I
            would lean more to will not help
            enough.   If horses are
            handled more by good leaders and by
            people that understand horses, then
            they become less resistance to all
            people.   However, if they
            are handled more by kids, not strong
            leaders or people that don't
            understand horses, then they tend to
            not respect all people and will test
            and push people more.
              <br>
            <br>
            I get questions from parents a lot
            and I tell them mostly the same,
            since you are asked the question and
            you are doing research and you are
            trying to improve your knowledge,
            that means nothing to the horse when
            the child is handling her.
              <br>
            <br>
            So anytime you can get a horse more
            in tune to respect you, then he MAY
            be less likely to test your daughter.
              But, since he already
            knows your daughter is weak (to her)
            I think she will continue to
            disrespect her and push her.<br>
            <br>
            I am reluctant to tell parents to
            make their kid learn.
              Horses are something that
            should be fun, when medals, awards,
            ribbons and speed or time is
            involved, the horse and child loses.
              <br>
            <br>
            You can make your daughter read books
            about horses, try and educate her
            about horses.   You can
            make up some test to give her from
            what you have learned.   I
            see too many kids being mean to
            horses because their parents told me
            to "show the horse who is boss".
              The horse knows she is
            stronger and can push your D around.
              You can only change this
            if you handle the horse more, are
            with your daughter all the time (hard
            to do) so you can correct the horse
            if is disrespectful to your daughter.
              Older horses will protect
            and keep higher horses away from the
            weak or younger horses in a herd, but
            they are there all the time so it
            works.<br>
            <br>
            I have seen kids that get it, they
            understand horses without being mean,
            they simply push and move the horse
            every time the horse pushes them, but
            they are consistent and do it all the
            time so the horse stops testing and
            stops pushing so much.
              Consistency with kids is
            not always easy, they get distracted
            easy, they just want to relax, have
            fun and not be so worried, like
            adults.   <br>
            <br>
            I would have your D read books while
            sitting with the horse, spend time
            with the horse, the more time she
            spends with the horse, since this
            horse is the lead mare, she may take
            her under her wing and see her as her
            herd and not want to push her so
            much, the flip side to this is the
            horse will expect your D to listen to
            her so she may correct her like
            another horses, with a bite or
            kick.<br>
            <br>
            This can be a dangerous situation,
            since your D knows this horse will
            kick she needs to be away and make
            sure she always has an escape and
            distance from the horse.
              If she acts too scared
            the horse will see this as weakness
            and will exploit it.   Any
            time the horse shows any signs of ear
            pinning, kicks, or bites with you
            there, you need to make this horse
            think it just committed suicide, any
            disrespect to your child needs to be
            addressed immediately, not 5 mins
            later or not after your child leaves,
            tells you and then you go out and
            give it a lesson, if you can't
            correct it within 3 seconds, it is
            too late and will not train the horse
            and will only make the horse fear you
            and people and may make the horse
            more aggressive towards people.<br>
            <br>
            So your situation is not unique, but
            there is not an easy answer either.
              Read my site and try to
            really understand horses better and
            then see if you can come up with ways
            pass this on to your D, have her do
            exercises with the horse, in order to
            teach her, you must first know the
            subject.   <br>
            <br>
            Don't blame the horse for anything,
            it is only being a horse, it lives in
            your world and is trying to figure
            out the rules and when it doubt it
            will do what horses do.
              In your photo I think I
            see that you are using a leverage
            bit.   This is painful and
            hurts the horse, it will not teach
            respect and will teach the horse pain
            and more resistance.   If
            your daughter can't ride this horse
              in a halter, then she
            should not be riding it.
              No spurs and no leverage
            bits for kids, it only pisses the
            horse off and gets kids hurt.<br>

    <p>  First I would say you need to
    not call your horse names.   Your
    horse is only a horse and any bad habits or
    negative behaviors have been taught to him by
    PEOPLE.   If you came off a race
    track you would not be happy either, handled
    every day by people that care about you, all
    they do is take you out of a stall run the
    crap out of you, put you on a hot walker, put
    you back in the stall and feed you high rich
    energy food and then keep you locked up until
    they want to run the crap out of you the next
    day.... not much a life for anyone,
    especially a horse, so cut him some
    slack.<br>
    <br>
    You said your self that he does better when
    left in pasture with his buddies.
      Of course he does, horses hate
    stalls, they hate being locked up, and they
    have lots of energy that needs to be let off
    and they can't do it in a stall.
      That will fix most of this.<br>
    <br>
    The other thing is he is biting and pinning
    and kicking all are dominance issues that
    should not be allowed.   You have
    to impress this horse that you are a leader
    and you will not allow that.   You
    do that by first not locking him up, then
    being a good leader, spending time with him
    not working him, take him for walks and
    grazing, and if he shows any disrespect you
    have to let him know that you can move his
    feet, back him up, make him move, disengage
    his hips and other things that make him
    submit and tells him you are boss and he does
    not do those things.<br>

    Read my horsemanship page on my site it will
    give you a better idea on where this horse is
    coming from.</p>

    <p>ANSWER: Since you have owned the horse for
    the 17 years, you have to try and figure out
    what is casing this.   It could be
    something you are doing or some type of pain
    the horse is feeling.
        Something changed to
    cause this new behavior.   Without
    more information, I can't really help.
      How much handling does the horse
    get, do you only feed and groom or is the
    horse worked or ridden, when does this
    happen, is it consistent, what else is
    happening around the horse when this happens,
    when does it stop, is the other horse around,
    is just doing this to you or others, does it
    stop doing this when you do something, is
    there always food present or involved, is
    there treats involved, does this happen in
    the same location all the time, what do you
    do when this happens, what do others do when
    this happens, how long as this been going
    on..... as you can tell there more questions
    than answers, so trying to give you an answer
    on this without more info is not going to be
    helpful.</p>

    <p>No I did not misread or skip the part,
    lots of people say they know it is there
    fault.   Saying this is not the
    same are really understanding Why it is your
    fault, not understanding this horse is just
    doing what you are allowing it to do.
      Being mean is relative.
      I will attack a horse that
    charges me, tries to strike or kick me, that
    is not mean, that is being aggressively
    assertive, so there is not confusion that
    these actions bring immediately and negative
    responses from me.   That is not
    being mean or mad, it is teaching the horse
    not to do things that can hurt me.
      It also makes the horse better,
    gives him boundaries and keeps him clear that
    he is lower and I am higher, he is not being
    mean when he kicks at me, I have let him down
    for not showing him that he cannot do that,
    showing him that is unacceptable and showing
    him that lower horses (him) do not kick
    higher horses (me) or they are moved and
    attacked, just like any other higher horse
    would do.   So being mean (to me)
    is more when someone tries to be nice to a
    horse, tries not to hurt the horse, tries to
    talk human to the horse and then sets the
    horse up for failure, sets the horse up to
    hurt someone and then the horse gets put to
    sleep for being a mean or dangerous.
      That is mean to me.
      So don't set this horse up,
    knowing it is your fault is only part of the
    solution, the other part is taking the right
    corrective action or taking the right
    proactive/preventative action to stop the bad
    behavior from ever happening.   If
    you keep this horse focused on you, make it
    circle you, make it back up a few steps, stop
    if every few steps, make it walk and then
    stop, make it walk backwards, stop and pet
    and rub it, all of this keeps the horse
    focused on you and not the gate or pasture.
      This shows the horse you control
    the feet and you control the horse's
    movement, so you are higher.   It
    does not have to be done mean or aggressive,
    just consistent and clear.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck, tell the horse thanks for letting
    you know that you have not been a good leader
    and that you were not clear on your position
    and the horse's position.

    <p>Hi Becky, training a horse is like
    building a house.   Can you imaging
    emailing me and asking, I am building a house
    can you tell how to do it.   This
    is a really broad question.   There
    are about a 1000 things that can get you hurt
    and another 1000 that may get you hurt and
    another 1000 that might get you hurt a little
    bit.   The point I am making is
    training a horse involves a whole lot, so you
    need to try and educate yourself as best you
    can.   I could tell you what to do,
    but I can't explain timing, I can't explain
    feel, I can't tell how to read every horse.
      I make my web site to help people
    understand horse horses and to help horses
    get a better deal.   My advice is
    to read my web site completely, you can skip
    the cowboy weather, but read it from start to
    finish, I touch on lots of things that get
    people in trouble and get horse and people
    hurt.   At least with this little
    knowledge it will help you, but by no means
    will it make you a expert trainer.
      Remember these things:<br>
    <br>
    The horse is best teacher of the horse.
      Listen<br>
    It is never the horse's fault.
      You cause good and bad,
    YOU.<br>
    The slow way is the fast way with horses.
      Don't rush or try fast<br>
    Never get mean or mad.   Be
    assertive, firm and fair<br>
    Learn to speak horse.   Herd
    behavior is key to working with horses</p>

    <p>Actually, from your email, you seem to
    blame the horse for pulling you and ending up
    on the ground.   Had you not hung
    on to the rope or not been in his way, the
    horse would not have knocked you down.
      You, like most horse problems,
    are really the problem (people problems).
      This horse is running and scared
    since he does not trust you and feel that you
    can keep him safe and he thinks you don't
    know what you are doing.   He may
    be right since you are ending up on the
    ground.   This horse needs a strong
    leader, and it he does not see you as that
    person he will run you down and be scared
    with you.  </p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: Like most people that don't
    understand horses, they always look to the
    horse for the problem.   I know
    that it is never the horse's fault.
      I would say it is you daughters
    issue or others if others ride or handle the
    pony.   All ponies tend to get bad
    reputations, they are bought and sold, they
    are owned by people that think they are a
    cute pet and know little about horses, then
    after the newness wears off, they are sold
    and they cycle starts over, I have never
    known a pony that did not have at least 3 or
    4 previous owners.   It is a bad
    cycle for a horse and they get bitter and
    resentful and then to start biting, kicking
    and rearing.   This is from years
    of abuse and neglect by people that don't
    understand horses.   Oats probably
    have nothing to do with this, lack of
    exercise, lack of proper handling, lack of
    consistent handling, rough and inexperience
    riders and hands are more likely the cause of
    these problems and it will get worse.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The following  question
    was  rather long, but it has some
    good points that  some of you may
    get from it.     </p>

    <p>I have had for horses for around 13 years
    and have our 2 girls in OJRA (Ohio Junior
    Rodeo Assoc.)they run barrels, poles, dummy
    rope and the oldest breakaways and goat ties.
    My wife also runs NBHA and I am an inspired
    team roper in the OTR (Ohio team roper) most
    are #8 or # 12 ropers. I currently use other
    members horses to rope as I try to finish out
    a QH to rope on. I put the training on hold
    and purchased a finished head/heal that Chuck
    Holloway use to pasture rope on, and did
    pickup on. The horse once owned by Walt
    Woodward I was told at one time as well or at
    least hauled by him. I have done all research
    on the horse and talked with Chuck and the
    breeder of the horse numerous times before
    purchasing.<br>
    <br>
    Horse-9 year old QH gelding (ranch/cow bred
    out of Eagle Butte, SD) 15.1 1250# very
    thick, big boned. He is stalled next to a 6
    year old QH mare, and kept with 3 other QH's
    (5 total horses). They do get turn out about
    every other day.<br>
    <br>
    My experience--team and calf roper (only for
    2 years), ranch work (cutting, penning,
    pasture roping 5 years) starting yearlings on
    the ground and in the saddle for numerous
    years.<br>
    <br>
    Problem-horse was abused by high school girl
    and trainer before I purchased him and now
    you can't mount him safely.<br>
    I really do not have details what they did to
    him, but am trying to find that out. I have
    only owned the horse for 3 days (picked him
    up on Saturday 1/17/2009), but he has settled
    in nicely and has bonded with our kids bay QH
    barrel mare. We are very slow with our
    training and believe you get a better horse
    in the end if you take your time. We make
    sure the bond is established first with the
    horse and that they understand we are the
    leader and protector.<br>
    On to the issues with him:<br>
    A. abused-we are trying to gain his trust and
    show him we are not going to beat, harm or
    neglect him in anyway. He is coming around
    and trusts us on the ground, but not when it
    comes to mounting. I was able to mount and
    ride him just fine on the day I picked him up
    (Saturday). I was also able to mount him in
    our barn and sit on him with no issues
    (Sunday night). Monday I took him over to the
    indoor while we roped and he was eager to
    haze, but would not let you mount. He dances
    around, and backs up violently. This all
    stems from the high school girl and the
    trainer obviously abusing him (for 3 months).
    I know this because he was not like this
    according to the owners before he left for
    the 3 month lease. So the problem I am facing
    is this is all fresh in his mind still and he
    thinks we are going to do they same thing
    they did. Last night (Tuesday) he finally let
    us get 1 leg up while his head was disengaged
    but upon trying to step down he went into a
    violent buck, with his head still disengaged.
    I was quick enough to get down before he
    tossed me but when my wife tried she hit the
    ground. We have giving Dusty (the horse) one
    on one time and worked with him together. I
    can see in his eyes the one on one he prefers
    and does not feel that much pressure versus
    two of us. So we are going to continue the
    one on one. I also realize 3 days is not
    enough time to fully gain his trust and
    respect, but he sees and understands us as
    his leader. His join up is excellent, he will
    lunge and listen perfectly. I am going to go
    back to the round pen with him and see if
    that makes a difference but the Ex-owners
    said it won't. I really do not want to hobble
    a 9 year old horse that already has trust
    issues if you know what I mean. We have done
    everything we have known to do in the past
    that has worked, but looking for other ideas.
    One more thing it is funny because he will
    let you mount the right side but not the
    left. I have no problem mounting from that
    side to confuse him for a while but would
    really like to mount the left. I have
    disengaged the head fully to the withers both
    climbing up and down but he still seems to
    have enough power to get us off. I am going
    to give him more time obviously and maybe
    even revisit foundation training steps and
    rebuild if I have to. This horse has a
    tremendous handle once you get on him (roll
    backs, slides, side pass etc.) Any ideas will
    help.<br>
    <br>
    It also just dawned on me this has been a tie
    down horse almost all his life. And I should
    try to mount and dismount the right side. I
    will try that tonight but any other ideas I
    can use.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>ANSWER</strong>: Well, not sure what
    caused this, but it does not really matter,
    he cannot do this and has to be shown that
    doing this gets him work and movement.<br>
    <br>
    On the hobble issues, all horses should be
    hobble trained and it is never too old to do
    it, if you do it right and set the horse up
    for success.   I have a hobble page
    and I would this anyway, not to deal with
    blow up issue.<br>
    <br>
    As for this behavior when mounting, I would
    be a little more aggressive on this issue.
      If he respects a lead rope and
    someone on the ground, one thing would be
    have someone on ground hold him and have
    someone mount and dismount while he knows he
    is being handled and held by person on
    ground.   Do this in round pen or
    with long rope secured in case he breaks
    free.<br>
    <br>
    Get a nightlatch/bucking strap (on my
    horsemanship page) put on your saddle to help
    stay in the saddle.<br>
    <br>
    Another thing is make sure he ties well and
    tie him and get on and off him bare back no
    saddle and don't stay on long, get on and
    slide off, lots of release for not moving,
    tie him short about a foot of rope so he
    can't move too much.   After some
    bareback mounts and dismounts, put the saddle
    on and do the same thing, set the horse up so
    he knows what to expect, after a few of
    success with this, put him in round pen and
    do the same thing, mount and dismounts, no
    riding, then start slow.<br>
    <br>
    If you can't get his head around to stop
    bucking you might try a war-bridle to help
    with leverage, but be careful this can hurt
    if you are hard, so just use it for
    leverage.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------<br>
    <br>
    QUESTION: Thanks for all the advice but the
    only thing I have not tried is the bucking
    strap, and the war bridle.<br>
    <br>
    On the aggressive mounting I tried numerous
    times to flex him and just mount, but that
    scares him even more. You have to be slow for
    him even to consider letting you up on the
    left side. He is the type that he must trust
    you completely. I have tried the bareback
    already sorry for not sharing this, and get
    the same result as well as tieing him. He
    gets so nervous he breaks the clip off the
    lead rope.<br>
    <br>
    I am going to try the right side tonight and
    see what happens. If you think about it which
    I did not (after 2 years of calf roping) he
    is a finished calf roping horse and 95% of
    the time you dismount to tie the calf on the
    right side of the horse if you are right
    handed and also mount back on that side. I am
    not saying this is the answer but the trainer
    in PA said the high school girl brought the
    horse to him because she could not mount the
    horse. And he described his training to me
    and it's sounds rough, not natural
    horsemanship by any means. He is old school
    and sounds like he beats them.<br>
    <br>
    Once I am able to mount the left side if ever
    I do plan on doing the old pressure, release
    trick. To many people around him scares him
    even worse, he is a one on one horse, but my
    wife has tried to hold him while I mount and
    we get the same result. He does respect a
    lead and person on the ground but as soon as
    you go to the left side (past his shoulder)
    of him that all changes. I plan on playing
    the old pressure release game with him as
    well regarding approaching the left side. I
    will approach him on the left and keep
    approaching him until he stops moving and go
    one step at a time. He knows what we are
    doing and knows what to expect when we
    approach that side. We have tried just
    lifting the stirup, touching his belly etc.
    when he does let us approach from the left to
    let him know we are not just approaching from
    that side to mount.<br>
    <br>
    Once you are and walk off with him he is fine
    and has one of the best handles I have ever
    witnessed. He is very light and if you can
    ride, you do not even need to cue him (rein,
    foot etc.) He will totally move off your body
    position in the saddle. If you sit back hard
    and continue to do so he will move into the
    trot, lope etc. If you look and lean (or
    shift your weight) to the right he goes
    right.<br>
    <br>
    I did work him hard last night after he
    tossed me on the lunge line, and even
    attempted to get back up after but got the
    same result.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: He is your horse so it is up to you
    on what you want to accept.   He
    may not like the left side, but bucking,
    throwing and doing dangerous behavior is not
    acceptable to me.   However, if he
    is gold everywhere else, what is wrong with
    mounting on the right side, who cares.
      If you are OK with that, then I
    would just mount on right side and over time
    he will bond and then maybe work of left
    side.<br>
    <br>
    I find it hard to believe that a horse that
    is doing all this is good on everything else.
      Most problems appear to be
    symptoms of lack of respect, fear or
    confusion.<br>
    <br>
    As for the horse breaking the snap, that is
    why I have an entire page on Rope Halters and
    tell people to get rid of snaps.
      You put this horse in a good rope
    halter with a good rope and NO snap and he
    will not break free and will learn to accept
    this.   Every time you try
    something and fail you teach the horse to win
    and to resist.   You have done way
    too much already and have not set the horse
    up so he can only find one right answer.
      You used a snap and allowed him
    to break it, so you taught him to pull and
    fight and then he can get free.
      You have got and your wife has
    been tossed off so now you taught him that if
    he bucks he gets release and gets you off, so
    now he thinks that is the right answer.
      You had your wife hold him on a
    lunge line and he got away, so now he does
    not respect a lunge line. My point is stop
    trying things that you cannot win and stop
    teaching the horse that resistance is the
    right answer.   You need to look at
    this from your horse's point of view.
      He gets sent to someone who hurts
    him, he has been mounted on the right side
    his entire life and now you have him and
    before you establish enough trust, respect or
    whatever it will take to deal with this, you
    try a bunch of things that set the horse up
    to fail (find the wrong answer).<br>
    <br>
    You said you plan on doing the old pressure
    and release trick???   It is not a
    trick, it is the main thing a horse
    understands and you have already done the
    "trick" several times and now the horse knows
    that you don't know.   Your horse
    is confused, scared or disrespectful and is
    looking for help and the right answer, so far
    you have taught him to pull when tied and you
    get away, buck when mounted and you get the
    rider off, pull when someone "tries" to hold
    you and you will get away.   This
    is common mistake, you are ALWAYS teaching a
    horse, even if you don't know it.
      If you are going to deal with a
    problem you have to set the horse up for
    success, that means knowing the outcome and
    making sure the outcome will be positive, if
    you just try things and then it goes bad you
    teach the horse bad and make the problem
    worse.<br>
    <br>
    Every time you email me you tell me you
    something else and it did not work.
      Sorry, but it did not not work
    because you did it wrong or you did not
    prepare the horse properly or you went too
    fast or you were not consistent or you used
    poor equipment or you did not understand what
    could happen and did not prepare for it.
      It is never the horses fault!
      And I know you are not blaming
    the horse, but knowing it is not his fault
    and then setting him up to fail is just as
    bad and blaming him.   You have to
    approach horse training in a mind set of the
    horse, not from being nice, not for feeling
    sorry for past treatment, not from let me try
    this and see if it works, all of this sets
    the horse up for failure, then the horse gets
    worse, then it has to be dealt with harsher
    by the next person and then the horse suffers
    and has to pay for all yours (and others)
    good intentions.   Intentions means
    nothing to a horse.   A horse
    always pays for our mistakes.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: OK this will be how I sum this up
    from what I am reading you are saying. I have
    done everything wrong, but upon talking to
    Montie Roberts training camp last night he
    said we are doing everything right and it is
    completely a horse trusting us issue. He has
    learned and did all this previous to us
    owning him and we have not taught him any of
    this, nor have we done the right things to
    fix it as to date. That is why I was asking
    your advice what is the right thing to do,
    and you have only told me what I have been
    doing is wrong. You can't put a rope halter
    on the horse he knows the difference and
    rears when he feels the pressure of it. This
    was demonstrated to me when I picked him up.
    I am not calling myself a certified trainer
    by any means, but have broke yearlings,
    trained roping horses etc. Everything I have
    learned from Clinton Anderson who only lived
    1 hour from me here in ohio, has not worked
    with this horse and I am seeking advise on
    what would be the right things to do. All you
    say is set the horse up for success, but
    don't state in this particular case how to do
    that (besides the bucking strap, war bridle
    etc.). Please be specific and tell me what to
    do or try next. I borrowed a bucking strap
    last night and that did not work he still ran
    off when trying to mount. He is completely
    terrified of us and everyone else for that
    matter. Do you think it is just a time issue
    for him to trust us??<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> It
    could be a trust issue? It could be numerous
    things and there is no way for me to tell.
      Monty is a great horseman,
    Clinton is a great horseman, I am sure both
    would tell you something different and they
    both could be right or could be wrong.
      You, Monty, Clinton and me have
    varied and difference experiences, we all
    have our own beliefs.   Each of us
    could take this horse and get different
    results, some good, some better, and maybe
    some bad, horsemanship is not about right or
    wrong, if it does not work, I think it was
    done wrong, it does not mean that you are
    bad, dumb, stupid or whatever name you want
    to put on it, it simple means the horse is
    telling you whatever you are doing is not
    working.   As a horseman you need
    to recognize this and try and figure out what
    will help the horse find the right answer
    (the right answer is what you want) right and
    wrong is nothing to a horse, they react to
    save their life and have no concept of right
    or wrong, they are just a horse, we want to
    teach them what we think right and wrong is.
      A person that wants a horse rear
    thinks his horse is right to rear, another
    person who does not want their horse to rear
    thinks this is wrong.   The only
    does what it thinks it has to do, the horse
    looks for the easy way, the safe way, the way
    his instincts tell him to survive.<br>
    <br>
    You still want to make this about You did
    nothing wrong and you did not teach this
    horse anything.   This is just talk
    and you see it your way, I see it mine.
      If you use a buckle and tie a
    horse and then do something that scares that
    you know scares the horse and you expect the
    horse to pull, and then the horse pulls and
    breaks the snap that you used, then I say you
    just taught the horse to pull and get
    release, you just taught the horse that he is
    stronger than where you tie him, you just
    taught the horse that when scared and if you
    pull you can get free (release).
      You send this to Clint, Monty,
    Parelli, Lyons or anyone other experienced
    horseman and I bet you $1,000 they will all
    agree.   You, like most of us
    humans, want this to be about ego, knowledge,
    experience, right, wrong, it's not me, it has
    to be the horse or something else.
      I am not saying you intended to
    teach the horse to pull, I am not saying that
    you don't know anything about horses since
    you did this, I am only saying the end result
    of your actions taught this horse to continue
    his bad habit of pulling, you did not help
    the horse, you did not teach the horse that
    pulling is wrong answer and gets you
    nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Please don't make this about me, you, Monty,
    right or wrong.   I am telling what
    I see from what you have told me and what the
    horse has told you.<br>
    <br>
    As for the horse not wanting or taking the
    pressure of a rope halter, I have to
    disagree.   I bet you a plane
    ticket and expenses that I can put a rope
    halter on this horse, tie this horse and
    mount this horse on the left, within a few
    hours at the most within a day.
      Does that help you, NO.
      I am confident that I could do
    this, and if you were close I would be happy
    to swing by and do it, but it would still not
    help you.   I do things to horses
    all the time that others say, can't be done.
      There are exceptions and maybe
    this horse is one, but from my experience, it
    is not the horse.<br>
    <br>
    Your comment that the bucking strap did not
    work, he still ran off.   A bucking
    strap will not stop him from running off, it
    is designed to help you from falling off or
    being thrown, so when he runs off he does not
    learn to get release (you falling off).
      You want specifics like many
    people do, I could write a book with a 1000
    pages and would not even begin to cover what
    little I know about horses.   On a
    scale of one to ten, with ten being the most
    knowledgeable person in the world on horses,
    I would say I am maybe a four.
      Many people think they are a
    nine.   It is all relative. 15
    years ago I may said I was a seven.
      The more I learn the more I
    realize how little I know.   Talk
    to any life long horseman and they will tell
    you every horse teaches you something new, it
    does not matter if you worked 1000 or 20,000,
    each horse is different, so when someone
    wants a answer to a question, you cannot just
    say do this and it will work.   Too
    many variables.<br>
    <br>
    I can say that I will show someone how to do
    something, I will do what I tell them, it
    will work and they will do it and say they
    did the same thing and it does not work.
      Then I do it again and it works
    and then they do and it does not work.
      They will still blame the horse.
      So for you to expect me to tell
    you over email how to fix a problem with a
    horse that I have never seen, never seen you
    work, never seen and then tell me about
    Clinton and living next door to someone or a
    training camp telling you that you are doing
    everything right, IT IS NOT WORKING.
      So you tell me, if you are doing
    everything right, why is not working?</p>

    <p>It is very hard to read emails without
    hearing a voice or seeing body or facial
    language, I get it all the time that I seem
    rude, but I try to stick to what I know in
    the shortest I can.   Tough horses
    teach us more.   The ones that
    stump us makes us better, it makes use our
    head to think outside the box, they force us
    to grow and make us better
    horseman.   The old saying Calm
    seas never made a good sailor, perfect or
    easy horses never made a horseman.<br>
    <br>
    You sound like you tried to take a short cut,
    thinking it would work and this horse said no
    way.   The slow way is the fast way
    with horses.   So you though to
    going back to the basic is good, but here is
    thought, sometime we get so focused on the
    problem that we make it a bigger deal than it
    is.   A good rule is stick to what
    you are start on.   Too often we
    start on one thing, the horse deflects us and
    before you know we are working on three
    different issues.   Not good for
    the horse, then they get confused and they
    have to guess what we want, but since we got
    diverted and changed what we were working on
    we made the problem worse.   Stay
    focused on one issue not all the
    issues.   Fix one part of the
    issues first, like getting off on the left
    side.   If he lets you mount on
    right, work him, do what he knows best and
    then start to get off (don't) shift your
    weight and make him think you are getting off
    on the left, be ready for his response or
    change, then sit back down or get off on the
    right.   Keep tricking him into
    thinking you are getting off on the left and
    then don't.   You should be able to
    get further and further each time, first
    shift weight to left, then take right foot
    out of stirrup, then stand on left stirrup,
    then swing right leg half over, do all this
    smooth but quick and then sit back down, he
    should react less and less, don't get off on
    left, this will teach YOU to read him, to
    know what to watch for, to know when not to
    go further, then after 5 or 10 rides he will
    learn that you fake getting off on the left
    and don't, he will start to ignore it and
    then one day, you get off before he knows it
    and bingo, you are off before he can react,
    and then work from there.  </p>
    <hr>

    <p>You seem to really be caught up in his
    fear, this does not make sense since he
    allows you to rope, run, control him, get on
    and off on right,   it he allows
    all this, then he knows respect, he knows you
    are higher, so his actions seem more respect
    (lack of) related.   I can't see
    him, so you have to read this, but you said
    you did not want him to buffalo you, I think
    you are on to something.   I would
    get on him, grab that bucking strap, lean
    back and try and get him to blow, and every
    time he thought about it I would redirect his
    attention to flexing, back up or circles then
    let him stop and fake a left dismount ready
    for a blow up, teach him that you know what
    he is thinking, you make him work when he
    thinks it and he can't just be blowing up
    when he wants.<br>
    <br>
    The rope burns on back leg could be from him
    pulling and running away with lead rope
    dragging or it could be they tried tot tie up
    a back leg.   If you can talk to
    trainer, ask him what was tried and what was
    results.  <br>
    <br>
    Some horses do not get the soft easy
    approach, especially if they have learned not
    to trust, so some require a little tougher
    methods.   I will not be beat by a
    horse, I will not give up on him even if I
    have to get what some would say is
    mean.   I know I have to make a
    horse safe or he will hurt someone and then
    they will want to kill him, so when I get
    tough, I know I do it to save a horse from a
    worst end.   If nothing else works,
    I would hobble and maybe sideline or cross
    hobble and get on this horse if that did not
    work then I go as far as tying up one leg and
    doing, but this horse would learn to accept
    me getting on and off him.   I do
    not recommend this to often and not saying do
    this, but if nothing else works, then I think
    you have to try every thing to save this
    horse so you can keep him and give him a good
    safe home.   I would also lay this
    horse down to help him deal with his
    fear.   This does not always word
    either.   My Mustang was so abused,
    I can't imagine, I know they cuts his nuts
    off with no anesthesia by tying his legs
    together, taking a knife and cutting them off
    and then setting lose in pasture.  
    This horse is so more anti-people than me, he
    will run off on you, he will disrespect you,
    he will challenge you everyday, he is the
    strongest willed horse I have ever worked
    with and he has taught me the most and never
    lets me get away with anything or he takes
    advantage of it.   Many times I
    think he needs a little lead to make him
    better, but I know it is not his
    fault.   He will dump me in a
    second and run off wildly if I am not paying
    attention, but he has a heart as big as Texas
    and the will of 10 stallions.   He
    was given to me since he was "crazy and
    dangerous", this horse will chase cattle, run
    up hills, swim a river and never get tired,
    but if you relax, if you don't pay attention,
    if you think he will not dump you, run off on
    you, drag you or let your guard down, he will
    exploit it and teach you a new
    lesson.   It is a love hate
    relationship, but every time he gets me, I
    know it is my fault for not paying attention,
    it is my fault for not setting him up for
    success, I feel I let him down and then I
    make it right, I move him and reinforce my
    position as leader, I work him until he
    decides to drop his head and show me
    submissive behavior and then we are good for
    a maybe a day or so, but if I don't work him
    for just two days, he his back in my face and
    challenging me to see if I am still in charge
    or if he can move up.   He is a
    tough horse and a lot of work and not much
    fun, but he is pure horse and I love him for
    him for that.<br>
    <br>
    So this horse is going to take you on a new
    journey, he is going to force you to try new
    things, he is going to test your skills and
    make you prove you are smarter and you
    deserve to be his leader, he will not roll
    over and just give in and he will make you a
    better horseman and a better person, if he
    does not kill you.  
    :(      <br>
    <br>
    With your past experiences you know how try
    different things or do the same things in
    different ways, you have to keep tying to
    figure this one out, out think him, out
    predict him, out smart him and teach him he
    can't win with you and his only option is to
    submit to you as his leader.   A
    million ways to do this, many that I don't
    know, but that is what makes tough horses so
    rewarding, they challenge you and just when
    we think we have horses figured out, one
    comes along and shows up we don't know
    crap.   :)  <br>
    <br>
    As a horseman I don't think you should say a
    horse will not accept a rope halter, it is
    your job to show him that he can accept it,
    that he has to accept it, and that you are
    doing this for his own good and you will not
    allow him to fail or settle for
    less.   You will not allow him to
    submit to his fear, you will not let him
    think that he can't and will show him he
    can.   Put a freaking rope halter
    on him and tie him and do some sacking out
    and show this horse he can get scared and it
    is ok and you will not hurt him if he gets
    scared.   Teach him it is OK to be
    scared but you can't blow up and run away.
    Teach this horse and he will soon learn you
    are smarter, you are a good leader and then
    he will trust you!<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps,<br>
    <br>
    Rick</p><br>

    <p>It is not fun him either.   You
    are looking at this as a horse
    problem.   I see this as a YOU
    problem.   I see this as you are
    not giving clear cues, the horse is confuse,
    the horse is not ready, you have not taught
    the horse what you want, you have prepared
    the horse so he knows what you want, you are
    going too fast, you are asking what the horse
    cannot give yet, you are pushing too hard or
    not pushing hard enough......   as
    you see, I think most all horse problems are
    people problems.   I think this
    since if a trainer, or experience horseman or
    someone can get on a horse and make the horse
    better and do things that another can't, then
    it always tells me that the horse can do
    anything if it is asked right, taught right
    and showed right.   A horse knows
    how to be a horse, too many people try to fix
    a horse, try to make a horse better, try to
    teach a horse.....   if people
    listened to a horse and learned from a horse,
    then there would be less horse problems.</p>

    <p>No matter what you are doing, it is either
    not working, the horse is confused, or the
    horse does not know what you want or what the
    right answer is.   It always comes
    back to you or me or anyone.  
    Until you see this as a you problem, YOU
    can't fix it.  </p>

    <p>Try going back to basic, get your horse to
    stop and go when you tell him, forget where
    he goes.... once you get him good at stopping
    and moving when you tell him, then work on
    moving and changing directions, left and
    right, stop and starts, then when he gets
    good at that, then have him go to one point
    and stop.   Then go to another
    point and stop.   If you take a few
    weeks and some time, you will get better with
    your cues and he will get better
    understanding what you want.   It
    is a partnership, not a horse that you have
    to constantly correct...???</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hi,<br>
    I have an 8 year old mare, TWH named Bella.
      She is a beautiful mare and is
    very sweet. We purchased her for my 11 year
    old daughter, however, not everything was
    mentioned about her behavior.
      <br>
    <br>
    When you place the saddle pad on her back
    while she is tied, she starts to pace back
    and forth.   She does the same when
    you place the saddle on her back and you have
    to move out of the way, holding onto the
    stirrup so that it does not fall with her
    pacing.   Once I get her to stand
    and accept the weight, I attempt to cinch her
    girth up.   At each time that I
    tighten the cinch, she does a little rear and
    a little more pace away from me.
      When I attempt to place the bit
    in her mouth while she is tied, she will rear
    away from the bit being placed in her
    mouth.<br>
    <br>
    Now, if I remove her from the tie and tack
    her while she is ground tied, she will stand
    almost normal.   She still does a
    little rear on the first tightening of the
    cinch, but only once. I can put the bit in
    her mouth without any issues.<br>
    <br>
    While riding, she is lazy.   I have
    been told that this is just a facade and that
    she is just waiting to explode. I have taken
    her out on more than a dozen trails and she
    does not do anything that would make me think
    she is out to hurt me or anyone else for that
    matter. She does not rear, buck, kick or
    bite.   She just does not want to
    move out unless all the other horses are
    moving out.   When I ride her
    alone, she just stands there and waits for me
    to kick her hard enough to get her to move
    out.<br>
    <br>
    I can work with the riding part of this
    senero, but I am unsure what to do about the
    tacking up part of her behavior.
      This horse was to be for my
    daughter, and she will not ride her because
    of the way she acts when tacking up. I just
    need some guidance in how to work with her.
      I have tried tacking her up and
    just letting her stand at the tie for 30
    minutes.   She does not seem to
    mind standing. She only acts up when I
    attempt to tack her up.<br>
    <br>
    Now, don't get me wrong, she has no ground
    manners.   She will try to out walk
    you everytime, but she is coming along with
    that training.   That is one thing
    I am good at working with on horses.<br>
    <br>
    I run a horse rescue, so funds are limited.
      I have had one person state that
    I need to hire a trainer.   I have
    been working with horses with behavior
    problems for many years, and only need a
    little guidance on how to handle this one
    thing.   Can you help?<br>
    Thanks,<br>
    <br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> Sounds
    like your daughter is smarter than you.
      I absolutely think you should not
    be riding this horse, from what you said.
      Your first sentence said she is
    very sweet, later you say she has not done
    anything that would make you think she would
    hurt you.<br>
    <br>
    Are you kidding me?   This horse
    has screamed it does not trust you, it is
    confused, it does not respect you, it is just
    letting you do some things some of the time
    and tried to threaten you with rearing.
      This horse does not love you. It
    does not want to kill you, but it will.
      Your question tells me you may
    have no fear, but you do not understand
    horses either.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is has no ground manners according
    to you, what in the world makes you think
    that if you can't control it on the ground or
    if it does not respect you on the ground, why
    would that change once you were in the
    saddle?   You give up 50% of your
    control when you mount a horse.
      So what every problem you have on
    the ground only gets twice as bad in the
    saddle.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is not mean, it is not bad and it
    can be fixed, but you need to either get help
    or really invest some time in learning horses
    better.<br>
    <br>
    I think you have been very lucky so far and I
    think you will get hurt if you continue with
    your way of thinking.   That is
    your choice, but this horse does not have a
    choice, it is being forced into situations
    that it cannot succeed, you are putting your
    safety and this horses safety in jeopardy.
      This horse will have to pay for
    the mistakes you force on to it.
      I don't have much pity for people
    who get hurt by horses since they have a
    choice, but I really hate to see a horse get
    put down, hurt or abused because people don't
    understand them and set them up to
    fail.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page, my bad
    horsemanship page and horseman tips page, it
    may give you better insight to horse and help
    you see what you are doing to this horse.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, I agree
    with you about the dancing crap that is just
    another form of abuse.   I still
    believe that most all horses can be helped.
      Since she does good on a lunge
    line, then I would lunge line her in a round
    pen, that way you can have better control and
    help support her with something she knows and
    is familiar with.   Another option
    is to bring a chair and some hay to the
    center of round pen, have a seat, set her
    free and let her figure it out, don't ask for
    anything, just let her run or come in and eat
    or wonder why you are sitting in the middle
    of the pen, another option is you don't go to
    middle and walk her to rail, take her halter
    off and let her get with you standing by the
    rail, I don't think she will run you over,
    but have not seen her, but normally they see
    you as pressure and will avoid you and if
    they can't run in a circle, they are forced
    to slow and think.   You could also
    put a temp panel in the round pen, creating a
    block so she cannot run in a circle and when
    he ran to temp panel, she would have to stop,
    turn around or slow and go around it, all
    making her slow and think and stop reacting
    (running)   Each thing you unteach
    her about her prior abuse or bad training
    will make it easier for her to learn
    more.<br>
    <br>
    It sounds like you have to teach her to deal
    with her fear.   Sacking out is the
    key here.   I have a section about
    this on my horsemanship page of my site,
    check it out and it will really help this
    horse if done right.   She has to
    be taught that it is OK to be scared.<br>
    <br>
    I would not put out to pasture, it sounds
    like this horse needs to be around people so
    it can learn not to be so nervous around them
    and learn that not all people are going to
    abuse her.   I would suggest having
    a good rider pony her on some trails, let her
    get exposure without a rider telling her what
    to do and let her figure out things and
    experience things from the end of a lead
    rope.   If you take her out 10 or
    more times you can, if the area and safety
    permits, take off her halter on the way back
    to the barn and let her follow the herd
    (horses and riders) and other horses on her
    own since she will want to head home (back to
    barn) and then can explore and figure things
    out without human interference.<br>
    <br>
    Time, proper handling and helping this horse
    learn to be scared but not react
    instinctively to her fear and teach her to
    think or look for direction when scared is
    the key.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> I am a 16 year
    old, who has had a cob on lone before ,and
    now has a 19 5month old dartmoor hill pony. I
    have had him for up to 4 weeks and some of
    his training is going ok ,but there is still
    some thing that worrys me about him ..... e.g
    he is fine when on the yard but when i walk
    him up the lane he starts to rear up and miss
    behaves. And all so when i try to clean his
    hoofs out he tries to bit me, also when i
    groom him he sometimes backs away from me.
    Please could you find a way to help me out in
    his first lot of training.<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> Jodie
    this horse is just being a normal horse.
      Since it is 19 it has been taught
    by a lot of people and has learned how to
    watch people and figure out who is going to
    make him listen and who is going to just ask
    for him to listen.   You have show
    him that you will accept that behavior.
      If you read my website,
    especially my horsemanship page, you will see
    that all horses see the world as a herd and
    this horse is treating you like a lower horse
    in the herd.   You need to show him
    you are a higher horse and that he is the
    lower horse.   Treat him the way he
    is treating you.   <br>
    <br>
    Read my site it will help you understand
    horses better and if you still have questions
    write me back.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> My first thought
    when I was reading was what your trainer said
    about you are irritating or picking or giving
    too much leg with no release and the horse
    has leaned to ignore your legs and to react
    negatively to your legs.   Then the
    arena issue came up and the horse can hate
    the arena and riding since it has become sour
    to feeling like it just gets ridden, worked,
    kicked, and has no fun.   Then the
    rearing issue led me to think that you are
    too tight on the reins and pulling and
    holding back too much so the horse is not
    looking for release, you may be trying to
    stop him from turning his head to bite but it
    is still pressure and he is looking for
    release.   You said your other
    trainer did not agree with your current
    trainer, what does he think the issue
    is.<br>
    <br>
    It does not matter what the issue is, it all
    comes back to you.   What you are
    doing is not working and making the horse do
    what it is doing.   It could not
    not enough time with the horse not working,
    no relationship with the horse, hard hands,
    too much leg, working the horse too much in
    the arena, not giving enough release, lack of
    consistency, lack of understanding, lack of
    communication, like most horse problems, it
    always comes back to us.   If we
    get the wrong answer we are asking the
    question wrong.   If you get better
    your horse will get better.   A lot
    of people get mad at me for always saying the
    problem is you, but it is.   A lot
    of issues you are saying happens a lot to
    older riders who have not ridden a lot, get
    back into horse and are more nervous around
    getting hurt, more careful, more fearful so
    they tend to be tight reined, always pulling
    on the reins for security and tight seated
    and not relaxed, this tends to cause exactly
    what you are describing.<br>
    <br>
    This is a you issue and not a horse issue, so
    if you change what you are doing, your horse
    will change what it is doing, too often
    people continue to do the same thing and then
    expect the horse to change, it will not work.
      The did not do this before you
    rode it, so it a pretty good bet you caused
    it, so you need to fix what you doing to get
    the horse to stop what it is doing.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is too late to
    show him there is nothing to fear since you
    went too fast and in his mind, jumped off,
    fell off or abandoned him, then tried to grab
    is his legs and scared the crap out of him.
      He is scared now more than ever
    and does not want to let you back on him.
      Since you TRIED and he has
    prevented you three times, you have now
    taught him that he does not have to let you
    and you can make him, so every you try
    something with a horse and fail, you teach
    him you are weak and not a strong smart
    leader.   So now that he has
    learned all this, your work will be ten times
    harder and take ten times as long.
      Hence the saying "if you take the
    time it takes, it takes less time" and "the
    slow way is the fast way with horses.<br>
    <br>
    I have a feeling the way you see things is
    not the way the horse sees them or you would
    not be where you are.<br>
    <br>
    You have made some really bad choices, set
    the horse up to fail, not prepared the horse
    and now the horse has learned some bad
    lessons.   It is much harder to
    un-teach bad lessons than to go slow and do
    it right.   So any advice now would
    not work until you start over.
      First read my horsemanship page
    so you understand a horse and horse behavior
    better.   You need to see this like
    a horse sees it and approach this as your
    problem and not the horse.   And
    stop trying things that you cannot win, every
    time you do you make this horse smarter and
    more resistant.<br>
    <br>
    I think from your you may already be over
    your head and may need someone who is more
    familiar and more comfortable with horses so
    they can teach you what not to do and teach
    the horse the right way so you can learn.
      <br>
    <br>
    This is an easy fix and can be fixed pretty
    fast, but it needs to be done by someone who
    knows how to do, who will not try and do, who
    understands horses better and will set this
    horse up for success and not up to
    fail.<br>
    <br>
    Read my web site and if you have questions
    write me back.   Whatever you are
    doing is not working, so stop and learn a
    better way before you try again.
      You cannot expect a horse to
    change if you do not change.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: This is a question that I'm
    pretty sure I know the answer to, so mainly I
    need confirmation. I have a 5 year old
    mustang mare that I picked up from the BLM 2
    years ago, she is 16.5-17 hands(I'm really
    not kidding.) For two years she and I have
    done ground work, mainly because she has been
    very unsure of her surroundings. It took Gig
    a year to relax within ten foot of me (she
    does not strike out but would spend an hour
    in constant motion.) Also, nervous sweat and
    snorts were huge features.<br>
    <br>
    She has had the winter off and we resumed
    round pen, leading and ground work and as
    such is relaxed enough to eat while I'm
    standing 2 feet away. She and I haven't done
    feet or belly work. Oh, and this is my second
    mustang (the other is six and I personally
    have greenbroke) and I have quarter horses
    and appys. Just never one quite like
    this.<br>
    So here is the part where I need advise: my
    assumption is that she is just barely
    starting to understand that I am not a threat
    and that mentally has just started her
    training. I should keep going slow to avoid
    her having 'issues'. Is this correct?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: No, I disagree with you, you are
    going too slow and this horse is training
    you.   You are taking this long
    because of you not the horse.   My
    mustang is pretty large and very herd savvy
    and very careful, alert, flighty, spooky,
    aware or whatever you want to call it.
      I can not baby him, I cannot go
    slower for fear of going too fast.
      <br>
    <br>
    You are putting your limitations on this
    horse.   You are staying in your
    comfort zone, you are unsure, you are being
    safe, you are worried about having issues,
    all of this tell me that your confidence is
    not where it should be and this smart mustang
    knows it, sees it and has your number.
      Don't make excuses for this horse
    which are really for you.   Push
    this horse and push yourself, stop babying
    her, show her you know what you are doing,
    you are the lead horse, you are in control,
    you are confident, if you don't believe it, I
    assure you a mustang won't believe it.<br>
    <br>
    :), so did you know the answer?<br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: Okay, wow. That is really
    accusatory. I'm sorry but geez, I'm not doing
    the extreme mustang makeover or have only one
    horse to deal with. And... do you have to
    answer a lot of question from people that are
    afraid of hurting their horses or being hurt
    by their horses?<br>
    <br>
    I didn't mention anything about babying the
    Gig, not pushing her, or mean to imply that
    I, at any point, stop a training session
    because I'm scared of her.<br>
    One thing I didn't mention was that her rope
    (tied to the halter) came off the 1st at my
    place. Which you may find significant. And I
    did not mention where she is at in ground
    work. She worms, stands for the vet, shots
    and teeth, bathes without being tied, walks
    over logs, takes a rope around the belly (not
    tight enough to mimic a cinch), lunges
    correctly in the arena, yields hind and
    forequarters, side passes from the ground
    and, what oddly too longer than all of these
    things: walks through gates normally (instead
    of backing away then bolting thru. That was
    fun to fix, sarcasm). I mentioned feet and
    belly (which is specifically under the flank)
    as her problem areas, as she dances away and
    towards me when we get to that area.<br>
    <br>
    My question was apparently lost in the
    explanation: I should assume that anything we
    worked of while she was in a panic/flight/I'm
    gonna flip over trying to get away' mode is
    not trained, yes?<br>
    I should discount the initial year as her
    'getting to you' period?<br>
    <br>
    Her relaxed point is where the brain actually
    starts registering what is going on. i.e.
    just because she stops fighting being snubbed
    to a fence does not mean that she knows how
    to tie (just as an example).<br>
    <br>
    With other horses I'd sack them out and start
    lunging them in a snaffle and introducing the
    saddle and really go after the feet but with
    her I'm thinking slowly get her used to it by
    'burning' her with the rope. (for anyone
    reading this: 'burning' is holding both ends
    of a rope and running it up and down the leg
    no actual burn damage done to horse.)<br>
    <br>
    And just so we're clear: my 4 mo old weanling
    is starting in a halter, the yearling stands,
    clips, ties, lunges and loads. My 2yo stud
    knows not to act like a snot with me. Plus 8
    other broke horses, none of have made me stop
    and say "I'm not sure where we're at and
    where to go next."<br>
    But Gig is the only one who ran wild for
    three years. And I'm kinda stuck with what I
    should focus on.<br>
    And, do you have any feet suggestions? The
    only other thing I know is to rope a foot and
    'take it away' but I really don't want rope
    burned hands and I'm not sure I could hold
    her. Which, if she got loose would teach her
    the wrong lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>   lol,
    you are killing me...   what you
    call accusatory I call giving you a guess
    with the information you gave me.
      If you don't tell all the
    information, how do you expect me to come up
    with a usable and productive answer.
      It would be like trying to figure
    out a math equation with only some of the
    numbers.   So I tell you I have 10
    numbers and they add up to 10,254 and I say
    one of the numbers are 3, so would you please
    tell me what the other 9 numbers are?????
      I can only guess.   You
    are not specific with what you want, what the
    horse knows, what you know, so I guess.
      Your first question was 9 lines
    and your follow up to tell me I was wrong was
    25 lines.<br>
    <br>
    You want to tell me "this horse is
    different".   All horses are
    different.   This horse is making
    you better and teaching you more and forcing
    you to try something different.
      You are doing the same thing and
    expecting different results.   I
    still believe the horse, over people, every
    time!<br>
    <br>
    This horse is telling you that you don't know
    how to get past his belly, his feet, or
    whatever else you want to think the issue it.
      This, like most all horse issues,
    is a you issue.   You want to think
    since you have done this with other horses
    and they are good, therefore, it must be this
    horse, Wrong!   This horse has
    identified a weakness in you, he has figured
    out how to prevent you from doing what you
    are trying to do, I don't care how he does
    it, he does it.   You can change
    this and teach him he can't stop you or you
    can continue to teach him he can stop you.
      You being human want to make this
    about the horse being wild, others want to
    make it about the horse being abused, others
    want to make it about something else, in my
    book, it does not matter a horse is a horse,
    they have a walnut brain and we are smarter
    (in theory) because of our brain and ability.
      <br>
    <br>
    I don't know you, don't know the horse, never
    have seen either of you work and if I did, it
    would still be somewhat of a guess or opinion
    on how or what to do next.   You,
    and others, want me to be right, specific and
    have an answer from only a "short" email from
    a person who sees the problem from their
    eyes, their filters, there knowledge or lack
    of knowledge and then want to tell me that I
    am wrong and the horse is wrong.
      I can be wrong, the horse cannot.
      The has no choices, the horse is
    stuck with you and your limitations, you can
    choose all actions and the horse either pays,
    learns good or learns bad.   <br>
    <br>
    You don't put a rope on a horses foot (hoof)
    to stop it from running, therefore it cannot
    burn the horse.   If the horse
    knows how to tie, then you just expose the
    rope and teach the horse, via pressure and
    release to accept the rope, anywhere, and
    give release.   A horse can only
    fail if you fail, a horse can only learn if
    you learn.   Stop thinking that
    just because you got lucky with a few horses
    that you know! This horse is telling you and
    me, that you don't know.   Learn
    from him, show him that you are a smart
    leader that even when you don't know, you can
    figure it out, you can come up with a way to
    help him learn, you can think outside the box
    to teach him.<br>
    <br>
    Every horse I work with that has a
    "so-called" problem, the owners give me a
    list of reasons why the horse has this
    problem.   And then when the horse
    does not have the problem with me, the light
    still does not come on. They still do not get
    that the problem is not the horse it is them.
      That is when I get the grand
    mystical explanations about how this horse
    likes me, or how I have a gift, or how the
    horse must trust men, or some other
    foolishness.   The answers are
    ALWAYS the same:<br>
    <br>
    A horse is a horse<br>
    A horse is a reflection of you<br>
    A horse knows if you know<br>
    It is never the horse's fault<br>
    It is almost always the human's
    fault............... which leads me back to
    you<br>
    <br>
    Bottom line, what you are doing is NOT
    working.   Change what you do and
    the horse will change what it does.
      Listen to the horse, it will tell
    you what works and what does not work, you
    may have find 20 things that do not work
    before you find what does...   it
    is up to you, not me, not the horse, you are
    the only one with all the choices.<br>
    <br>
    Or of course you can always blame me for
    being rude and not knowing what I am talking
    about and email other people for advice until
    you hear what you like.... this seems to work
    for a lot of people..
      (sarcasm)...   <br>
    <br>
    I have tons of stuff on my site, read it,
    something may click, something will hit home
    and you will get something from it, but only
    if you make a choice to read it with an open
    mind and forget those silly human emotions
    like pride, ego, arrogance, and many others
    that get in the way of "thinking like a
    horse"...<br>

    <p>Question:   hi and thanks for
    reading this. and i have read your web page
    and its helped me alot.<br>
    <br>
    two questions first one.<br>
    1)can you wash your horse to much? i have
    never had a problem with this but i wash my
    horse about once a week   in the
    summer i thing its good for the horse and me.
    lol. i turn her loose and she just roles in
    the dirt when im done but some one told me it
    was unhealthy to wash your horse this much.
    (my brothers wife said that, been eating on
    me,   they dont like how i train or
    even ride my horse because i am way into
    natural horsemanship and they do things
    cowboy way but hay you never no she might be
    right so thought id ask. dont want to hurt my
    horse)<br>
    <br>
    2) i got my horse very soft but for some
    reason i am having trouble teaching her to
    yeild her front hind quarters she know how to
    move her back in and out of saddle. heres
    what ive been doing so please tell me whats
    going wrong, ok i always start training out
    of saddle before i exspect it to happen in
    saddle so i have been standing on the ground
    putting pressure on her shoulder tring to get
    her to yeild her front legs but all she keeps
    doing is moving her back legs in a circle
    like i was pushing on her hind quarters but
    im not. i dont no what to do im stumped. so
    please help? shes a very fast learner so i no
    i have to be doing it wrong.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer:   Well, washing a horse
    too much depends?   Are you using
    soap?   If you are then that is too
    much.   If you just hosing the
    horse off with water and removing some dirt
    and sweat, then it is fine.   Soap
    is not good for horses since it removes oils
    and leaves detergents and chemicals behind.
      It may make them look cleaner or
    shiny but not natural or helpful.
      In the summer I hose my horse off
    every time I work them into a sweat, it helps
    remove salt and makes them cooler and then
    they roll in the dirt which helps scratch
    their skin, distributes oils and removes dead
    hair, all natural.<br>
    <br>
    As for your other issue, it sounds like the
    horse is confused.   Try backing
    your horses into a corner of a fence, facing
    out away from the corner.   Then
    move her front end/shoulders left and right,
    since you remove the ability for her to back
    up, since her butt is in the corner of the
    fence, then she will know what you want, once
    she does this good, then try it with her butt
    against a wall or fence, she will tell you
    when she gets what you want.   This
    does not sound like a reisitant issue, but
    more of a confusion issue, so that tells me
    your cues are good enough, you are not
    helping her find the right answer by prevent
    the wrong answers.<br>
    <br>
    If she is hobble trained, you could hobble
    the rear feet and then only her front feet
    would be able to move. This would not be my
    first choice, but the you teach the wrong
    answer (allowing her back up) the more harder
    it will be to re-teach her the right
    answer.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question: I recently adopted a 6 year old
    mustang that was on its way to slaughter.
      She was very underweight, but has
    recovered well.   We have no
    history on her but she appears to be worked
    with, broke to lead and tie, you can touch
    everything on her, she does not spook BUT SHE
    HATES having her back feet messed with, which
    causes a problem with hoof care.
      I have been trying to work on
    clicker training and approach and retreat
    technique with her, but she still stamps her
    feet when I try to touch the back...Any
    suggestions or good articles to read?</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Read my sacking out section and my
    horsemanship page on my site.
      This is not a horse issue, you
    are not doing something right since the horse
    is not getting better.   The horse
    is telling you that you are doing it wrong,
    if you keep doing the same thing, you will
    not get different results.<br>
    <br>
    This sounds like the horse is just being
    resistant and knows the worst thing you will
    do is click.   Clicker training may
    be good in something, carrots may be good in
    some things, showing a horse who is boss for
    some things, having calm patience for some
    things, being aggressive for some things,
    many ways to train a horse, and the only
    right way, is when you get the results you
    want.   <br>
    <br>
    This is simple and easy fix for someone who
    understands pressure release, sacking out and
    talking to a horse so they can understand.
      This is not happening, not
    because I say so, because the horse is
    telling you so.<br>
    <br>
    YOU say "she hates it", I say she knows she
    does not have to listen, she knows you are
    not a strong leader, she does not respect
    you, she sees you as a lower horse, you are
    doing it right.   Big difference in
    what most people see with horse problems and
    what I see.<br>
    <br>
    You say this is causing hoof problems.
      I say you are failing the horse,
    you are fixing this so the horse cannot get
    proper foot care.   You did not
    work with her feet enough, you did see this
    problem and work on it enough before it
    became this big problem.<br>
    <br>
    Read my website from start to finish and you
    will see horses differently and then you see
    this problem differently and then you change
    what you do and then the horse will change
    what it does.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question: I was wondering if you had any
    advice on how to get my horses to drink from
    their water tub again.   I had a
    water de-icer in their tub, but I noticed
    they quit drinking from it.   When
    I put my hand in the water, I felt a tingle,
    not a major shock or anything, but a tingle.
      I took that de-icer out
    altogether and just broke the ice for them
    for a while, they wouldn't drink. Then I
    bought a new de-icer-it's working perfectly
    fine, however the horses still will not drink
    from it.   Is there a way I can get
    them to trust it again?<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Try throwing a few apples on top,
    they will float, maybe give them a bite and
    then drop the rest in the water, pour a
    teaspoon of salt in your hand and see if the
    lick it and then they might take a
    drink.<br>
    <br>
    This like most problems is not a horse
    problem.   You failed to check it,
    you taught them they get shocked (tingled as
    you say) when they drink and now they
    learned.   Had you been more
    prudent, checked, made sure the think worked
    you would not have this issue, as I am sure
    you know, but this is a common problem with
    horse owners who love their horse and then do
    what I call, "set them up to fail".<br>
    <br>
    You may have to get a different bucket for a
    while, you may have to bring them warm water
    from the house for a while, you have to put
    out several different water buckets and let
    them choose.<br>
    <br>
    Horses are one the most sensitive creatures
    on the earth, they can shake a fly from the
    hip when it lands, what you call a tingle was
    not a tingle to a horse, it was an electrical
    wave that they felt and it was more than just
    a little uncomfortable or they would not be
    avoiding it so much that they wont
    drink.<br>
    <br>
    In the mean time fill up their grain buckets
    with water or put a hose in on and let it run
    slowly so it will not freeze so at least they
    get some moisture.   Impaction
    colic is more common in the winter.
      This is another case of people
    wanting to help so much that they end up
    hurting the horse more.   Much like
    blankets, stalls, shoes and other things
    people do to horses in the name of loving
    them.</p><br>

    <p>Question:   I hope you may offer
    me some insight into the behavior of my 14ish
    blue-eyed QH gelding. I brought him home from
    the trail stable where I used to work after
    he developed an ulcer in his right eye. (More
    common bc of the blue eyes? Not sure, if it
    matters.) Stable couldn't pay the vet bill,
    and so I did, "buying" myself the horse. It
    was a pretty terrible looking thing, but
    healed fairly quickly, considering. Now he
    has no visible scaring in the eye, and rides
    as good as ever (at least for someone who
    requires respect from him, but he has never
    done well with riders without leadership
    skills :) I am sure you understand.).<br>
    <br>
    I recently moved, and my new neighbor has a
    round pen he lets me use. I have no way to
    tell if this horse had ever been in one
    before I got him, but he took to it
    wonderfully. His transitions are beautiful.
    Locks on quickly. Smart boy, despite his
    years of over work and confusing
    tourist-riders... All that, until I try to
    work him with his right side turned to me.
    Going this way he tenses up (practically
    screaming at me with his body language), cuts
    in drastically- not on top of me, but as
    quick as he can until he has turned himself
    around so he can see me with the left
    (healthy) eye.<br>
    <br>
    The more I tried to get him going, the more
    scared and tense he became. So I quit. Maybe
    the wrong thing to do, but I didn't want to
    do more damage than good by sending the wrong
    signals. Not too proud to admit when I don't
    know what I'm doing ;).<br>
    <br>
    So all that background, and now the question:
    The vet says the horse has no loss of sight,
    but could he be wrong, based on this
    behavior? Or is my boy just testing me? Edgar
    has a bit of a dominant personality that I am
    used to dealing with, but this seemed like
    more than that. If he IS actually partially
    blind in this eye, should I worry about the
    roundpen at all? We still trail ride with no
    problems, and were long before i suspected a
    problem. If I should continue to roundpen and
    he is inhibited, do you have any tips on how
    to get him to trust me on that side? Let me
    also mention that otherwise he shows no
    particular spookiness on the right side, and
    blinks normally at motion as well (waving my
    hand there, etc.)<br>
    <br>
    I would appreciate your honest advice. I
    realize you are not a vet, but what does it
    sound like to you?<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>Answer: As usual I can only guess by what
    you tell me and like most questions I get, I
    have more questions.   Do you
    lunge the horse on line, when lunging do
    you have the horse go both ways, does he show
    any problems with on line being lunged, this
    would be my first few questions.
      I tend not to believe much of
    what I am told so even if the vet said the
    horse has no sight loss, I would cover the
    good eye and see how the horse handled things
    with only the possible bad eye open.
      Then cover the other eye and see
    if the horse changes, that would tell me
    better if the horse has eye issues.
      Just because the horse did not
    lose any sight, there are other things that
    could be going on, loss of night vision, near
    sighted, far sighted, impaired depth
    perception, clouding, loss of focus... just
    like our eyes, we can have many varied
    issues.<br>
    <br>
    The horse is telling you something, what that
    is, I am not sure.   I would force
    the issue without doing smaller steps to set
    the horse up for success.   Before
    I push a horse and come to conclusion that
    the horse is being resistant or dominant, I
    want to make sure I have ruled out all other
    possible causes.<br>
    <br>
    So I would do the eye cover thing on each eye
    and do lunging on line both ways, and do
    circles while riding both ways and make sure
    the horse is equal on both sides.
      Once I am convinced the horse is
    capable then I would go back to round pen and
    try and work calm and slow, both ways, as
    soon as the horse looks to get tense in a
    direction, help him and change direction to
    the other way, take him back to where he is
    comfortable, slow him down and try and slow
    direction change to the uneasy side and try
    and keep him slow and controlled, if he gets
    upward or nervous then take control, slow,
    stop him and change direction to calm him.
      He may just be nervous from lack
    of work on that side, he may have eye issues,
    he may have shoulder or back issue, hoof
    pain, uneasy or just feel insecure that way
    so he compensates by trying to take charge
    and be strong, so it may not be he is pushing
    you, but may be dealing with what is going on
    in his own way, help him, understand that you
    do not know and build him comfort level, but
    still be a strong leader and control him
    direction, speed, stops and turns.
      There should be no running until
    he is Responding, not reacting, and tells you
    he is ready for faster speeds.<br>
    <br>
    Horses need understanding and just fast
    results and total acceptance of everything
    new or different.   It takes time,
    exposure, repetition, consistency, confidence
    and lack of pain or fear all coupled with a
    firm fair and strong leader.<br>
    <br>
    And I would be remiss if I did not say you
    are causing this, making it worse, not
    preventing it, not helping it and teaching
    this in some way.   If you get
    better, the horse always gets better.
      Just maybe you are not that good
    in a round pen and you need to figure out how
    and what you are doing to contribute to this
    behavior.<br>

    <p>Question: I have a dyer old warmblood
    gelding, He has been a great horse, he has
    been very patient with his green rider, and
    has taught me many a valuable lesson.<br>
    <br>
    I bought him as a just broken 5 year old, the
    person i bought him from also started him, he
    was wonderful throughout the whole "starting
    process".<br>
    <br>
    I had lessons with this person for the first
    five years of our training, being personally
    connected to the horse, she kept things very
    basic for the whole time, we did lots of
    lateral work and walk trot, lunging and in
    hand work she did   not want me to
    canter as, i quote "it was such a good canter
    she did not want me to stuff it up". so i
    never did.<br>
    <br>
    she left us three years ago, i had to find
    someone to keep us moving forward and
    cantering had become a problem, my guess is i
    was worried about stuffing it up and was
    sending him mixed messages so after a few
    weeks of trying i would ask %26 he would just
    stop. I should mention, perfect on voice
    command on the lunge.<br>
    <br>
    We had several lessons with a great female
    instructor who is a great dressage rider. she
    has us cantering and doing simple changes
    willingly in the first lesson but she was not
    available to give us any more lessons as she
    was getting ready to compete overseas.<br>
    <br>
    Then 18months ago i got very ill and had to
    undergo treatment, i was not allowed to ride
    %26 although it almost killed me i was very
    rarely even allowed to go visit him.
      i didn't want to just put him in
    a paddock somewhere so i sent him to an
    instructor who was a student of the previous
    instructor. within the first two weeks he was
    rearing on every step, full rears straight up
    with no going forward, i explained he had
    never done that before even dealing with a
    green rider, she told me he had been lazy for
    too long and needed to be snapped out of it
    and was acting out.<br>
    <br>
    it went on for a month before i was able to
    get clearance to go visit, after seeing it
    myself i called in a stock horse rider the
    next day who jumped on with no extra gear
    just simple bridle and saddle and after two
    rears straight off the bat Jonti went
    forward, he on occasion tried to trow one in
    but really he was quite forward and
    responsive.<br>
    <br>
    My suspicion was that he may have injured
    himself or at the very least had been working
    so hard that he was stiff and sore and that
    he was in uncomfortable or in pain. i
    insisted they at least give him some time
    off. i had a chiropractor go out and work
    with him. it was confirmed Jonti was very
    stiff and sore and after two weeks of time
    off and treatment, she put him back into
    work.<br>
    <br>
    Within a couple of months he was back to
    rearing again.<br>
    <br>
    The day i was given the all clear i put my
    gear and went out to ride, within a few
    minutes i knew something was up, he was not
    moving as his usual loose fit self he was
    stiff and not supple or accepting at all, he
    did not rear but i felt i could not push him
    either. i loaded him straight on the trailer
    and we went to the vet, he did not pass the
    flexion test and x-rays showed bone changes
    to the areas around the coffin joint. the vet
    told me to get rid of him and find myself
    another horse... I found another vet, we
    found that Jonti had a soft tissue injury to
    the back of the left fore foot (possibly a
    tear in the DFT) we decided to give him some
    time off to see how he looked. six months
    later he is in a paddock and spends his days
    terrorizing everyone. He is not showing any
    signs of the lameness he once showed even in
    the walk. so after discussing it with the vet
    i am going to start him back into work in a
    few weeks... Very slowly.<br>
    <br>
    i am worried about the rearing... after
    reading a few other e-mail you have written i
    realise that it is the rider and to be honest
    i always thought it was, but can horses learn
    it as behavior? if he is sore will he rear on
    me or will he show me little signs? The woman
    who had him told me he was dangerous and that
    he would kill someone. She has put the doubt
    in my mind and i will admit although i know
    the Jonti i knew would never do it is it
    likely she has changed him?<br>
    <br>
    your opinion and any advice would be greatly
    appreciated. Many thanks in advance.<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: First I don't see any bad manners
    by this horse.   All so called bad
    behavior is taught to horses by people, so
    anything a horse does, is the fault of people
    around them.   Bad horses are never
    born, they are made.<br>
    <br>
    You, like many women in horses, want to look
    for things that cause behavior, like pain,
    abuse, neglect, bad fitting saddles, lack of
    vitamins, hormone imbalance and many others.
      And some of these may be the case
    in some horse.   But normally,
    horse behavior is created by the people
    handling the horse.   <br>
    <br>
    The problem is once a horse learns that by
    doing these things (refusing to go forward
    and rearing) then it becomes habit and the
    horse learns to do to get out of work.
      And each time someone new 'tries'
    to fix it and fails the horse gets better and
    better at it, so it is harder to fix and more
    dangerous to horse and rider.<br>
    <br>
    The horse could have been injured by someone
    not knowing what they were doing and caused
    the horse to flip over and hurt itself, now
    the horse is scared and confusion, of course
    most people that do this do not tell the
    owner since they don't want to be blamed or
    billed for vet expenses, which is why I don't
    let people handle my horses unless I am there
    and even then I am quick to intervene if I
    see bad lessons being taught.<br>
    <br>
    So not sure if I covered your questions or if
    I answered what you were looking for, but
    that is my take from what you told me.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question:   I just recently
    rescued a 2yo Tennessee walker mare who has
    one eye, she is very uncontrollable.
      I have been trying to train her 4
    times a week using pat parelli methods but
    nothing is working she is still just as bad.
    she kicks in her stall, kicks at people, she
    kicks at me when I touch her legs, just kicks
    at every thing. Also my farrier will not trim
    her feet,he says she is to badly behaved, she
    rears in the cross ties and kicks out.
      I don't blame this on her, it is
    from lack of training and socialization from
    when she was a yearling and having one eye
    doesn't help.   Also recently she
    ran right through 3 lines of electric fence.
      I don't want anyone to get hurt
    around her. I think inside all horses are
    good horses and she is not out to kill anyone
    but my BO wants me to give her away or put
    her to sleep.   Now I don't know
    where to start should I try a different
    training method? which one? I really don't
    want to give up on her. Please help me<br>
                  <br>

    Answer: This horse is a baby and has had bad
    handling by people that dont understand
    horses.   The horse kicks since no
    has taught it not to kick.   You
    need put the horse out with other horses so
      they can teach it how to behave.
      Keeping a horse in a stall causes
    a lot of this since a horse hates to be
    locked up.   So this young baby
    horse has been set up to fail and what you
    call rescue, is not what I call it.
      You are talking and getting
    advice to kill this horse because you don't
    know what you are doing.   I do not
    think that is what rescuing is about.<br>
    <br>
    Just because you think you are doing Pat
    parelli method, you don't understand horses
    at all.   The one eye thing is an
    excuse by people that can't accept
    responsibility for not knowing and screwing
    up horses.<br>
    <br>
    I have seen blind horses that are ridden and
    are calm and fine.   Killing a
    horse is never justified, it is an excuse and
    a bad one.   Give the horse to
    someone who really wants to rescue the horse
    and who understands horses.   You
    say you don't blame her, I would rather you
    blame her and not be talking about putting
    her to sleep.<br>
    <br>
    Why dont you try learning more about horses,
    do research, read, go visit other good
    horsemen, find someone local who can help you
    or at least find the horse a good home.
      When people write me about loving
    horses, rescuing horses, not wanting to be
    mean to horses and other crap and then in the
    same questions talk about putting a horse to
    sleep, my response is I would like to the
    them what they do to horses.<br>
    <br>
    Anyone that suggest putting a horse to sleep
    for kicking is an idiot and deserves to be
    kicked.   You say you are worried
    about others getting hurt around the horse, I
    am worried the horse is going to be killed
    being around you and others that don't
    understand horses.</p>

    <p>Question: What is your philosophy the use
    of horse shoes? I am collecting perspectives
    on the topic without judgement. My experience
    is that they are 100% not necessary and in
    fact detrimental to the whole system. This
    can be considered a complicated question when
    considering all the factors, which I
    understand as I have examined this issue
    extensively for several years. what is your
    experience with the use of shoes? Do you use
    them? When/Why? Can you see how they may
    cause harm to the physical/biological makeup
    of the horse? Thanks, from one tuff gal- i'm
    not afraid of anything you may say- I've
    heard alot already!</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: I did an article on pros and cons
    of shoes, here is a link:<br>
    <br>http://thinklikeahorse.org/index-13.html#12
    <br>

    <br>
    Short answer, it is an archaic tradition that
    bad for the horse and just another way for a
    lot of unethical Farriers to convince the
    unknowing that they are needed.
      If you read my horseman tips
    page, I have some very good photos of the
    hoof and how it should work naturally.
      A metal horses shoe stops all
    flexing and natural action of the hoof.
      The nails compromise the hoof
    wall and let in bacteria which can cause
    issues.   Horse shoes and jumping
    are two very popular things that people like
    to think horses like or it helps horses, they
    both do lots of damage to the horse's legs
    and hoofs and horses were designed for
    either.<br>
    <br>
    If you review some of my other answers about
    horse shoes I am sure you will get more info,
    I also discuss this in different areas on my
    site.   I am not a fan, don't like
    them, if I was a horse, I would not want
    them, and if you think they are good, then
    put a metal plate in your shoe and walk
    around for a few hours and then tell me how
    it does not hurt the horse.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question: Hi Rick,I really enjoy reading
    the answers you have given to people,finding
    it funny how those folks don't like what you
    suggest for them to do to fix the
    problem.Most of them just don't like new
    ideas,they think that there is nothing wrong
    with them.Oh well! I hope you read this and
    do answer my dilemma!I own a saddlebred
    gelding that is 10 years old. He is with one
    to four other horses all the time. He always
    paces the fence line,for hour at a time,back
    and forth with his head hung over the fence
    lifting his head up and over each post as he
    passes by them.I know his keeps him in good
    shape,but I can hardly keep weight on him due
    to his constant walking.He walks for 6 to 8
    hour a day.It doesn't matter if he is in the
    pasture with grass or in the corral with
    food.He only eats a little bit and then off
    to the pacing,stopping occasionally for a
    nibble then back to it.Thanks for your
    time,hope you answer.Thank you Larry</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Pacing is a coping behavior for a
    horse that was either locked up alone or
    locked away from other horses. He is doing to
    since he has learned to find comfort and
    safety and probably has used this to occupy
    his time from going stir crazy and getting
    cabin fever.   I would definitely
    stop it somehow.   Where ever he is
    looking is causing some draw, either a stall,
    the barn, food, some place he wants to be.
      I would make it hard for him to
    do it.<br>
    <br>
    First if you take him and put him I would
    stop that and leave him out 24 7 with other
    horses, not alone.   Then I would
    put obstacles in his pace path, lay down some
    railroad ties, lay down some old gate, some
    round fence post, some tires, water buckets,
    cones bricks, plastic tarp, wooden crates,
    anything that makes it hard for him to walk a
    straight line or path along that fence.
      I would put up extensions or long
    poles so he can't get his head over them when
    he walks, then maybe run some hot wire to
    keep him off that fence, then tie some
    plastic bags to the fence at different levels
    and spacing....   basically make
    that fence hard work to pace. Have that fence
    become very busy, make him have to walk over
    and around things in order to pace that
    fence, you can put up some temp panels at
    ever other post to make him hit a corner at
    each post so he has to change direction or
    walk about the panel (like a T at
    post).<br>
    <br>
    If you find the draw (whatever the horse is
    looking at or where he wants to go (his
    attention)) then if you remove that draw.
      If it is the barn, then he only
    works at the barn and never gets to relax
    there, if it is a horse, then put the horse
    with him, if it his stall, then don't put him
    in the stall for a while.<br>
    <br>
    This is a habit and once you break it he will
    forget and move on.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck, use your imagination, make the
    wrong thing hard and right thing easy.
      Pacing wrong, make it
    hard.</p><br>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question: Hi, I'm having a problem with
    this one horse I've been trying to buy. The
    man who broke him used what I think you call
    the old "macho tough cowboy" style, and now,
    this horse is so frightened of people, you
    can't get near him. At least, most people
    can't. I've been trying patiently to get him
    to relax, and he's started to let me walk up
    to him. Good, right? The problem is that his
    owner says that she needs to get rid of him
    NOW and if I'm not going to buy, then I can't
    come out to see him any more. And my trainer
    has only ever seen him at his worst, so she's
    pretty much dead against me spending time
    with him, since she thinks he's super
    dangerous. (I know- all horses are dangerous.
    But this one just needs some understanding!)
    Can you either give me a suggestion of what
    to tell her, or a way to make the horse calm
    down enough around someone else that she can
    see that he isn't some sort of wild beast. I
    know this is sort of an "out-there" question,
    and I understand if you can't help answer it,
    but could you please think about it and try
    to help me?</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: This sounds more of a people issue
    (owner) than a horse issue and my way of
    handling people normally pisses them off. I
    would tell the owner, you know the risk, you
    are an adult and want to take the risk and
    will not hold him or the horse responsible
    for what happens.   If you can't
    get back the ignorance of people you can't
    help the horse.   I see horses
    every day that need help very badly, but
    their owners are so ignorant and ego driven
    that they would don't care what their horse
    needs they care what they need, how they feel
    and what they want.   The most
    selfish and mean spirited people I have ever
    met are into horses at barns.   So
    not sure if that helps on that.<br>
    <br>
    As for the horse, all horses are scared,
    especially wild Mustangs, I realize this fear
    may be from abuse and a wild horse's fear is
    from instinct, but I don't think it matters.
      Horses are herd animals that look
    for leaders.   Leaders (higher
    horses) push lower horses.   By
    pushing this horse, requiring it to move,
    controlling his direction, speed and movement
    all tell the horse you are stronger smarter
    and a good leader, that is what removes fear
    from horses.   Not bribes, not
    love, not trying, not understanding their
    past abuse, none of that matters to a horse.
      If you do this the horse will
    start to trust you, will understand that you
    understand, will want to be with you, will
    follow you and will forget his past.
      If you just try and be nice and
    try and convince him to trust you and try and
    show him that you won't hurt him, his fear
    will get worse since he will see you weak, he
    will not trust you and will not want to be
    around you and all ignorant people will see
    this as calculating, mean, dangerous, crazy
    and other crap.</p>

    <p>Question: We recently bought what we
    thought was a gelding. He is 4 and looks
    gelded. However, when my mare came in heat,
    he actually bred her and acted very
    "stud-crazy". He went through a fence and she
    kept encougaging him. We had to pen them both
    up and he about broke down the barn. We do
    not want or have facilities for a stud.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: I discuss this on my horse heath
    page and my horseman tips page.   A
    would would have to check him to be sure.
      Time after gelding is a factor
    too, so depending when he was gelded, it may
    take a few months or so for this behavior to
    go away.<br>
    <br>
    If he is gelded and he is breeding the mare,
    so what.   Let them hang out, they
    will be horses and when she wants him to stop
    she will let him know.   Keeping
    them locked up apart only increases the drive
    and causes more problems and stress.</p>

    <p>Question: My daughter bought a 15 year old
    mare in September, We were told the mare was
    not pregnant but in October she miscarriaged,
    since then we have not been able to put
    weight on her. The vet flushed her and gave
    her antibitics for 10 days and he said all
    the infection was gone. He said just feed her
    well and give her a few months and she would
    be ok. We feed her rice bran for about a
    month and didn't see any results. Now we are
    feeding her crimped oats with alfla cubes,and
    she has hay available all the time. She is
    still underweight and it breaks my heart and
    my daughters. What can we feed her to get her
    on the road to recovery?? Please help us and
    our horse.<br>
    <br>
    Answer: Sounds like you are doing OK.
      Oat hay or Rye hay is also good.
      It takes time to put on weight as
    long as she is eating, keep her moving, take
    her for walks to stimulate her eating, put
    her with another horses, she may be depressed
    from the loss or have some hormone issues,
    but none of that should matter, if she is
    eating, she should recover.   Lots
    of hay available all the time so she can eat
    when she wants.   Some rolled oats
    and rice bran is good.   The
    alfalfa cubes, are OK, I don't like them
    since they are easy to choke on but if you
    get some bailed alfalfa and give a flake or
    so a day with the grass hay, I think that
    would be better.   <br>
    <br>
    Exercise and playing with other horses will
    help her grow muscle and eat more, but let
    her put her weight on over a few months don't
    rush it or you may cause colic.
      After four months or so, then I
    would have the vet do more test, but it takes
    a while for a horse to lose weight and it
    takes a while to put it back on.<br>
    <br>
    Keeping her locked up, alone and over feeding
    is much worse than her being skinny, so don't
    do that.</p>

    <p>Question: Hello, I bought a buckskin
    gelding who is approx 7 yo about 9 mo ago.
      The lady we got him from was
    selling him for a friend and knew nothing of
    his history or training other than he had not
    been ridden in &gt; 1yr.
      Initially he was very anxious, he
    pawed and dug in his pen x 2 days and would
    stand in one corner of his pen all day (I
    watched him- literally stood there all day).
      He was hesitant to be pet or
    groomed and would stiffin up or even walk
    back to his corner.   These issues
    have resolved.   His ground
    behavior is still slightly hesitant, but he
    halters, saddles, and takes a bit
    beautifully.   When I initially
    rode him he would not whoa or even walk.
      Once on his back he wanted to go
    (completely out of control) irregardless of
    commands.   He whoas when I am on
    the ground to just verbal command (so he
    knows whoa), and he has since learned to walk
    with constant queing.   This horse
    has been rein trained, turns on a dime, and
    is VERY sensitive to leg pressure (even just
    leg movement).   The problem is his
    bad attitude is coming out.   He
    will not drop his head even after being
    lunged for 30 min, and is even giving me a
    hard time going into the round pin.
      When he is commanded to whoa
    (asking and/or pulling back on the reins)he
    either shakes his head and/or pulls it down
    in attempts to pull the reins out of the
    riders hands while continuing to move.
      He wants to go fast all the time,
    but not in a controlled way.   I
    ride him with neck reining, leg cues, and I
    have a light hand.   When asked to
    turn he turns fast and takes off, even a
    slight movement (no cuing) to my foot he
    takes off.   He has improved since
    I initially rode him as far as walking, but
    he runs through every bit I have tried from a
    less   severe bit to a high port
    straight bit even a hackamore, a twisted
    snaffle, a regular snaffle, a copper roller,
    a reining bit... it's all the same to him.
      He is so high strung and pretty
    much a wild card when we ride.   I
    would say 1/6 times when asked he stops
    momentarily.   I have pulled the
    reins hard to 1 side and touched his nose to
    his back... he will cont to walk in circle or
    even lean hard to the other side as if he is
    going to fall over.   I know he has
    some kind of cutting training, he is real
    cowy.   Once saddled he will follow
    me, like I said he is great on the ground. I
    don't know how to make him just stop, listen,
    and relax.   Am I doing something
    wrong?   What can I do to change
    this behavior?   I know he has
    potential, but I have just about had it. How
    do I get his attention when ridding?</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: You appear to be blaming the
    horse.   Most all horse problems
    are people problems.   Read my
    horsemanship page on my site, it will help
    you understand horses better.</p>

    <p>Question: Hello Rick!   There
    was a photo I saw on YouTube, where two
    mounted policemen where crossing an open
    grassy area in something like a park.
      One horse had stopped, spread its
    back legs wide, lifted its tail high, and was
    relieving his bladder.   The rider
    had leaned forward bit, and had moved his
    lower legs up along his mount's flanks.
      Would the policeman have needed
    to move his legs so as not to get splashed??
      I once saw a mounted NYC officer
    whose horse was voiding on the street; in
    that case would the officer have his legs
    splashed?   Also, in the photo the
    other horse seemed to be looking over at his
    companion; might he have been noticing what
    the first horse was doing?   Does
    one horse ever decide to open the waterworks
    when a horse nearby relieves itself?
      Thanks!</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Where a rider sits on a horse is
    where the horse's kidneys are at.
      So it is considered good
    horsemanship to lean forward with a horse is
    voiding his bladder.   By leaning
    forward it takes pressure on the horse's back
    and kidneys which is said to make it more
    comfortable for the horse.   A good
    horseman will always try and and make his
    horse as comfortable as he can.
      The legs could have moved to
    prevent splashing, but by leaning forward the
    legs naturally go back in order to shift the
    weight to the front of the horse and hold
    yourself off the horses back.<br>
    <br>
    Horses do not like to pee on themselves so
    they spread out (also called parking) in
    order to avoid splashes.<br>
    <br>
    As for the other horses keying on this, it
    depends.   Sometime a lower horse
    will go if the the higher horse goes and
    sometime they key off each other and others
    times they don't, it depends on the
    situation, comfort level of the horses and
    the surroundings.   Normally horse
    being ridden together do not want to fall
    back or get separated so they stay close and
    will not pee as to not get left, so if they
    both have been holding for a while and one
    goes, the other will seize the opportunity
    and go as well.<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>Question: hello sir. may i know how does
    bareback riding gives a good balance to the
    rider?</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Riding bareback is just one way to
    get better balance.   If you ride
    in a saddle with stirrups you tend to use
    your legs more and not use your hips,
    stomach, shoulders and arms for balance, so
    you get lazy and only use your legs in the
    stirrups.   By riding bareback you
    don't have stirrups so you can't just use
    your legs and this forces you to use your
    entire body, which builds those muscles and
    the stronger they get they better your
    balance becomes.<br>
    <br>
    As I said this is one way, being in shape and
    not over weight helps, riding more helps,
    doing other things like riding bides, walking
    on boards, climbing ladders, playing sports
    that require balance all help.
      Like most things with the body,
    the more you use it the better you get and
    the less you use it, the worse it gets.</p>

    <p>Question: Hello, I have had this mare a
    few months now she is only 4 and as yet
    unbroken.   She was imported from
    Holland before I came to own her and was kept
    in full time due to lack of grazing for a
    week at the dealers I bought her from, but
    was allegedly living out before.<br>
    I let her chill out for the first day and
    take everything in, on the   second
    day I turned her out in a 2 acre paddock next
    to my second horse, expecting her to let off
    some steam and have a chat with her new
    buddy.   She trotted into the field
    up to Cruise had a chat and seemed relatively
    ok, until she turned around, from this field
    you can see the whole of the yard and all the
    other fields.   I think she was a
    little overwhelmed by this as she stood very
    tense and snorting loudly twice then pacing
    along the fence to a different spot to do
    this again.   Obviously she was
    relatively stressed but due to her not
    galloping around I didnt gather how
    stressed.<br>
    I watched her for 20 mins and figured she
    should settle, so I popped to get some
    haylage to take her mind off things, but she
    was too stressed to eat, and was sweating
    alot, so I clipped on the leadrope and spoke
    softly to lead her back through the gate to
    chill in her comfort zone the stable.
      Whilst walking across the field
    as she wouldnt leave the level of the field
    she was on, she spent most of it on her hind
    legs, but as soon as we went through the gate
    onto the enclosed drive she calmed down and
    walked as normal as you expect a 4yr who is
    panicking to walk.<br>
    I put her into the stable and sponged her
    with warm water and put on a thermatex type
    rug to avoid a chill and dry her quickly, but
    through the stress she experienced in the
    field for 30mins she brought about spasmodic
    colic and understandably became dangerous to
    herself and everyone involved.
      After the vet had sedated her and
    given her painkillers etc she improved
    quickly and was lovely and relaxed when she
    came around properly.   The vet
    told me to give her a small dosage of
    sedaline before turnout the following day so
    I followed the instructions and she behaved
    the same in the field, even though I have now
    reduced it to a 3/4 acre plot and she can no
    longer see as far, due to her sedation she
    was not able to work herself up into a sweat,
    but she isnt happy out, she doesnt seem to
    understand grazing, could she be agraphobic?
    It just seems a bizarre problem as it isnt a
    natural reaction for a horse to hate turn out
    to the point of self destruct is it?<br>
    I have been putting her in a tiny paddock
    just next to the stables since for 5 mins a
    day but she wont graze and gets very wound up
    even in this short time. The poor girly just
    stares and snorts and I cant pin point what
    at, how can I help her through this? She isnt
    great in the areana either but not as bad at
    all. I would hate to give up and just keep
    her in full time as it doesnt seem fair on
    her even though she is docile and chilled
    when in.<br>
    Final note she wont graze in hand either,
    sorry for the essay.<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>Answer:I think you are making more out of
    this. The horse may have been locked up so
    much that it feels fearful and insecure when
    not locked up, this is common when horses are
    neglected and abused, in my opinion, by
    people who want to love and protect a horse
    or by people that don't have time to catch a
    horse or train a horse so it easy to keep
    them locked up.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is born a grazing animal, it will
    go back to it.   If let this horse
    go, it would run, it may panic for a while,
    but it would eventually stop and want to eat
    and drink.   You say you let out
    for 5 mins, that is just making the problem
    worse.   A horse sleeps maybe 2
    hours a day, that leaves 22 hours of boredom,
    a horses system is made for constant eating
    and grazing small amounts of food, so the
    colic was caused by the stress with a full
    belly, would be my guess.   Don't
    feed the horse for a day before you turn her
    out, she will less food in her belly, she
    will be hungry.   Your first
    instinct was to give her hay after 20
    mins.<br>
    <br>
    All horses stress when let out in a new
    place, they snot and run to test the area for
    danger and to warn any predators.
      You stood there for "20 mims" and
    made this into a big deal and felt the need
    to save this horse.<br>
    <br>
    You, like a lot of women, have this mother
    instinct to save and protect the horse.
      Horses always do better when
    people stay out of it.   After 20
    mins you say you put a blanket on the horse
    to prevent a chill. I have seen horses run
    for hours and sweat and they make it.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to make this horse so dependent
    on you that you have watch and save it every
    five mins or 20 mins, then nothing I can say
    will change that.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is a horse, it is doing horse
    things and you are seeing what you want to
    see since you are not thinking like a
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to try and put this horse with a
    buddy horse in a stall or other small area,
    leave the two horses together for a week or
    so ALL THE TIME, NOT JUST 20 OR 30 MINS,
    after a week with another horse, 24 hours a
    day they will buddy and herd up, then put
    them out together and let them be horse.
      After you let them out, LEAVE,
    and go have a cup and coffee and worry by
    yourself, so you won't have the urge to save
    them and interfere.   <br>
    <br>
    And like anything you do with a horse, the
    horse may get hurt or it may not.
      YOU CANNOT stop this no matter
    how hard you try and normally only make it
    worse by trying.</p>

    <p>Question: I have a young Qh who is 2 1/2
    years old and has been real mean bites,runs
    at us kicks just about anything he could ever
    do to us he has tried now. this is our first
    year with horses, we got a 4 year old gelding
    with this horse in May of '09 and at first he
    wouldn't mind us touching and everything but
    just recently he started being Mean.... how
    can we fix this issue?</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: This horse is NOT being mean.
      You are making him act this way
    since you do not understand horses.
      Read my horsemanship page on my
    web site and it will explain why this horse
    is treating you like a lower horse.
      This horse is being a perfectly
    normal horse and doing exactly what every
    horse will do when handled by people that
    just want to pet it, love it and treat it
    like a dog.   Big difference in
    Predator pets like dogs and cats verses Prey
    pets likes horses.<br>
    <br>
    The short answer is how do you fix this, fix
    yourself, learn about horses, study them so
    you understand them and then you will stop
    calling them "mean" since you do not know
    what is happening so you put a label on the
    poor horse.<br>
    <br>
    My website has over 400 pages of information
    about horses if you take the time to read it
    you can fix this, if you just look for fast
    answers or short cuts of tricks, then you
    will never understand this horse or any
    horse.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: I have a 7 year old Arab (I've
    had him for 2 years.) He is amazing in the
    ring, wonderful when being led, and loves to
    work. We can do a gazillion desensitizing
    courses and he won't get spooked, but the
    second we go into a show ring or out on a
    trail, he goes nuts. I am not scared when he
    flips out, so therefore I don't think he is
    getting scared because I am - I can lead him
    on a trail and go through the exact same
    situation and he'll do great, then get on him
    and do the EXACT thing again and he flips. I
    started on a trail ride once and he freaked
    over a phone pole, I ended up sliding down a
    hill on his back while he was rearing.<br>
    I didn't get off him when that happened, we
    went back to the corral and worked for about
    two hours, but I did not go on the trail
    ride. We have 200 acres of trails and I'd
    love to be able to use them - please help me,
    any advice would be appreciated and I will
    not get mad if you say it's my fault...after
    all there isn't a problem horse, just problem
    people.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Well, you are right on the last part,
    I do think you are either causing this or not
    being a good strong leader so the horse will
    not do it, you are not giving good clear and
    understandable directions, you are making the
    horse confident, you are not aware of what
    you are doing, you are not aware of what you
    should be doing, you may expect this and then
    that ends up causing it.... it could one of
    these or a combination of two or more.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is telling you something.
      It is screaming at you and you
    need to find out why and what you can to to
    help this horse.   This horse does
    not want fight you and does not want to do
    anything you are explaining, it shows that
    since it does fine when you off him.
      You are doing the same thing and
    getting the same results. You do not see this
    as the horse is confused, the horse is
    insecure, the horse is not respecting you,
    the horse does not think you are a good
    leader.   You have to see this as
    if you were the horse, what is going on, how
    can you help, how can show him what you
    want.<br>
    <br>
    I can't believe that if walked a horse over a
    log both directions 2 or 3 times, and then
    sent the horse over the log 2 or 3 times and
    then got on the horse that the horse would
    not walk over the log.   Most
    horses like to go back home, back to the
    barn, back to their friends and other horses
    where they feel safe.   So if you
    want a horse to do some thing that is hard,
    then have the horse do it in a direction it
    wants to do.   So walk the over the
    log a few times both directions and then get
    on the horse and have it walk over the log,
    facing and going back to barn, not going away
    from barn.<br>
    <br>
    I think you are trying to fix all this and
    that is why nothing seems to work.
      Break it down to each little
    thing.   Each problem needs to be
    dealt with so the horse learns to win, learns
    to learn, learns that it is ok to be scared
    but you will help him, "not make him".
      Each time you help him, the next
    time will be easier.   You have
    accept small little victories and not try and
    make a "perfect horse".   All
    horses are scared, the ones that don't act
    scared are being handled right and by people
    that understand them, the horses that are
    scared and "flipping out" as you say are
    being handled by people that can't help the
    horse, that can't change what they do, that
    can't admit they are causing the horse to be
    that way.   You have had this horse
    for 2 years, no telling what the first 5
    years were for this horse, two years is
    nothing to undo 5 years.   This is
    just normal horse stuff, this horse is
    teaching you, so learn from him.
      He will make you learn new ways
    to help him, he will make you better, if you
    grow, if you think you are not scared, not
    doing anything to cause this and this is a
    horse problems, then you will not grow and
    you will do what most people that don't know
    do.   Sell the horse, send it to
    trainers, fight with, keep doing the same
    thing and expect different results.<br>
    <br>
    This needs to be a challenge, you need to try
    and out smart this horse, you need to help
    the horse learn, find a way to work through
    each of these problems.   This
    really sounds like a leadership and
    confidence issue from you.   You
    may think you know and think you are
    confident, but you can't fool a horse, a does
    not care how much you think you know, the
    only knows what you do.   Either
    you can help him learn and make him safe and
    better or you can't.   A horse
    knows, this horse knows and now you need to
    know.   Fix yourself, when you get
    better a horse gets better.   This
    horse would not do this if I rode it, I can
    almost guarantee it. But every if I rode this
    horse and it did not do any of this, it would
    not change anything, except maybe to prove
    you to that the problem is you.
      And even then I have had many
    come up with other reasons, so even seeing it
    does not convince those who are sure it is
    not them.<br>
    <br>
    As for the rearing down the hill, I assure
    you that was your fault.   The
    horse was being forced by you, you were using
    the bit and reins, you were putting pressure
    and the horse could not handle it, it was
    confused, it felt trapped or fearful and that
    is what normally causes rearing.
      You made a point of saying you
    don't get off the horse when he does this,
    this is this belief that not getting off a
    horse is somehow always good.   I
    don't believe that.   Sometime
    getting off, putting the horse to work while
    you are on the ground helps the horse feel
    more confident and understand better, then
    get back on and try it in the saddle.
      I hear this all the time, my
    horse bucked me off and I got back on, that
    is not smart and is just a good way to get
    bucked off again and each time a horse bucks
    you off he learns how to buck you off
    better.<br>
    <br>
    So look to yourself for the answer and the
    problem and if you work on it from a horse's
    point of view you guys will grow
    together.</p>

    <p>Question: I have an 8 year old
    thoroughbred gelding. I got him from a
    thoroughbred rescue a few years ago, he was
    trained for racing but only ever had one
    start. I am doing lower level dressage and
    eventing with him. I board at a stable with
    about fifteen other horses and he is pastured
    with about five other geldings, and is alpha
    among them. He is not herd bound, in that he
    does not mind being ridden alone or separated
    from his group at all. He's a really nice,
    well behaved horse, and is progressing
    through his training well and always
    impresses me. I normally school him alone in
    the ring at home. His 'issue' presents itself
    when we ride with other horses. In schooling,
    or warm ups at shows, when another horse
    approaches us from the opposite direction, or
    passes closely, he spooks, kinda big. I have
    had him outside of a ring, just standing
    still, and he spooked when another horse
    walked over to us. He will usually do this
    three to five times each outing before he
    gets with the program and can pass like a
    normal horse. I just feel as though this
    behavior/reaction is kind of odd (not normal
    horse reaction) and was wondering if you had
    any insight as to what would cause this type
    of reaction. It's easily dealt with, just
    annoying, and sometimes the other horse will
    spook too because my horse spooked, and I
    don't want to ruin anyone's ride. Maybe if I
    knew why he was doing it I would be able to
    find a way for him to stop. Your insight is
    appreciated.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Sounds a little odd, since I
    always look to what people do to cause horse
    issues, my response would be you may be
    expecting it, you may be reacting internally
    and the horse knows it, so he reacts.
      You may be gathering up the
    reins, making sure you have a good seat, or
    just thinking, here it comes, get ready.
      So that is my first guess.
      Next, I think sometime people
    make a big deal out of things that are not so
    it becomes a big deal.   I am sure
    it is not fun and may be a little annoying,
    but out of all the other bad things he could
    be doing, this is pretty minor.
      Also horse people (mainly women
    since that is most horse owners) tend to
    always be concerned about why?
      why this is happening is not as
    important how you can help the horse get
    better.   So try and focus on that.
      I get tired of hearing, my horse
    was abused, my was treated bad by men, my
    horse was a rescue, my horse was screwed up
    by .....bla bla bla......   I can
    work with a horse and never know a thing
    about his past and do just fine.
      In fact, I think that is better
    so there are no preconceived expectations or
    negative opinions.<br>
    <br>
    You got a good horse, no one has a prefect
    horse and when this goes away there will be
    something else showing up if you change your
    routine or expose the horse to something
    new.<br>
    <br>
    I would ride and sit on this horse by every
    gate where horses come and go, I would sit on
    him by every arena where horses are being
    worked or jogging by or moving.   I
    would sit in the middle of arena while other
    horses worked.   What ever this is,
    "ride time" "exposure" will fix it.
      The more the horse is exposed to
    it, the more it will become normal, the more
    it will become routine, the more the horse
    will know what is going to happen before it
    happens since it happens all the time.
      <br>
    <br>
    Also don't worry about ruining others ride,
    if you get on a horse, worry about your
    horse, not others, I did an article on
    "control your horse, not the world".
      The more you focus on your horse,
    the more your horse will focus on you.
      Another thing to do is when a
    horse approaches put your guy to work, have
    him flex both ways, have him take a step
    back, move his rear or move his front, this
    will put his focus on you and listening to
    you and then he may not have so much time on
    his hands to just worry about other horses
    approaching.<br>
    <br>
    I don't think this is a horse issue and if I
    rode this horse, I don't think he would do
    this.   When I get on a horse, I
    make sure the horse knows, his job is pay
    attention to me, not other things.
      Horses pick up on this and adapt
    very quickly.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: Hello Rick, I read your response
    to the girl with the abused draft.
      I have the exact same problem
    with the exact same circumstance although I
    believe mine to be worse.   I have
    been working with horses since I was a little
    girl and never had one I could not get right.
      This horse is now 9, I have owned
    him for 4 years.   whe I first got
    him you could not even get near him without
    him lunging to bit or double barrel you.
      I was able to ride him, he was
    magnificent, he picks up his changes
    wonderful, very light on the mouth but after
    2 weeks he just went bazerk.   I
    put all of my ground work in, sacked him out,
    desencitized and also did alot of round pen
    work.   He is wonderful in there
    but the second the saddle goes on, he is
    nuts.   If I put 2 people in there
    he gets worse like he is ready for the fight
    but he is ok with just me.   I
    mount and get off a hundred times, I bend him
    left to right, right to left over and over
    but I asked him to walk forward and up and
    over we went.   I tried it again
    and now he just rears every time you go to
    mount so he learned yet another bad habit.
      He has not been ridden or messed
    with all summer because I was told by my
    husband if I go out there again to ride him
    he will be on the next trailer out.
      I feel he is out of my expertise
    at this time and do not know what else to do.
      Part of me says let him go but I
    am afraid of what will happen to him if I do
    and the other part of me does not want to
    fail this horse.   What are your
    thought?<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: I answer many questions so I don't
    know what you referring to when you refer to
    another questions.   It sounds like
    this horse is flipping over when you ride him
    and since he has done this and it gets him
    release, he has been taught to do it more and
    better.   This happens all the time
    when people want to try with a horse and then
    teach bad lessons.   You said you
    owned him for four years and now this
    problem, that tells me you or whoever else
    worked the horse caused it and taught it.
      Moot point now the horse knows it
    and is now dangerous.   I am with
    your husband, don't ride him.
      This can be fixed but not by you
    or by me over email.<br>
    <br>
    My thoughts are you have a few choices.
      My first option is you taught it,
    your problem, your responsibility, so getting
    rid of the horse is BS in my book since that
    is what most people do after they teach a
    horse to be dangerous and then the horse
    suffers or is killed, but the person who
    caused it gets a free pass since they get rid
    of the horse.<br>
    <br>
    So, you can make this horse a good pasture
    buddy and ground horse, you can try and teach
    it to pull and make it a pulling or carriage
    horse.   You can pay someone who is
    willing to take the risk and re-train it,
    this can be fixed but if someone tries and
    does not know what they are doing, they will
    get hurt, not your problem, just make sure
    you tell them so they know what they are
    getting into and can't come back on you and
    say "she did not tell me".   I
    would have them sign an agreement so you have
    proof they know.<br>
    <br>
    You can find the horse a good pasture home
    where he can retire or be a pasture mate for
    some other horse if you don't want to keep
    him.<br>
    <br>
    Emails like yours get old, since I see them
    everyday.   I got a horse now it is
    dangerous, what do I do? Horses are never
    born bad or mean - they are made.
      The fact that people don't mean
    to do what they do does not help a horse that
    is sentenced to life of misery, beatings or
    bad homes until he is killed.   I
    don't have much sympathy for people that do
    this to horses and want some nice kind answer
    from me.   In the end "the horse"
    always pays and that gets me fired up.<br>
    <br>
    So I don't know you, sure you mean well, may
    be a great sweet person that everyone loves.
      You have a horse that is now
    doing something that jeopardizes HIS life and
    he was not doing this before or you did not
    know it until 4 years.   Yes I know
    the horse was abuse, I am sure he may have
    taught this before, you may believe you did
    not teach this or contribute to this in any
    way, none of which changes anything for this
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    So you can do what I think is the right thing
    and keep the horse or find it a good pasture
    home.   Or invest time and money to
    try and fix it.   <br>
    <br>
    That is my thoughts.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: Rick, I think you got my story
    correct but also wrong.   This
    horse was purchased from a sale by a horse
    trader friend of mine.   He was
    very mean, no one wanted him.   The
    guy called me because I had turned some
    horses out for him in the past and thought I
    could handle him.   I got on him
    and rode him and decided that he was
    something that I could work with, he was
    about 4 or 5.   I thought Frank had
    had him for a few months, turned out he just
    got him 2 days ago.   I did not
    want to see him go back to a sale.
      The next time I got on him he was
    worse, so I put in the ground work in.
      I gave him the time he needed to
    trust me.   I went to get on him
    after ground work was finished then he came
    up and over.   I did not cause the
    problem, I found it.   I have kept
    him for 4 years afraid to give him to someone
    else.   Sorry if you misunderstood
    me.   I am not an expert but know
    enough not to start something that I cannot
    finish or to teach a horse a bad behavior.
      When you get a horse from a sale,
    the true personality takes a week or so to
    come out I think mostly because they are
    scared and nervous.   He is a 17hh
    TB who hates men and only likes me.
      I earned his trust and deserve
    it.   I have had trainers come out
    who will not get on him.   I hear
    there are no untrainable horses but i beg to
    differ on this one. If I could find someone
    willing to help him be a horse again I would
    give him to them because he is an athlete.
      10 mover!   He is a
    beautiful black and white paint who just
    needs more than I know how to do. Thanks for
    the input though.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: I am still confused, if you kept him
    for four years, why NOW?   It
    sounds like you rode him twice and then let
    him sit for 4 years, why the new need to fix
    this.<br>
    <br>
    As for you saying you did not cause it, I
    still don't believe that.   My
    guess is this horse has never flipped back
    when no one was on him.   Therefore
    by you getting on him, you did cause it.
      You did not prevent it. You did
    not teach the horse not to do it.
      All   of this means you
    caused.   I know self protection
    comes in and sometime you have to forget the
    lesson and just survive.<br>
    <br>
    You statement about hating men, in my opinion
    is bs, I have worked with many horses who
    "don't like men" and they liked me fine and
    worked great for me.   <br>
    <br>
    I am not sure where you are located or what
    your funds are like, but I would bet if I
    worked this horse he would so called "like
    me".   I don't believe horses
    associate sex with learning.   They
    like other horses or people who understand or
    work with horse like a horse.   My
    guess is the men that have been around this
    horse do not know or understand horses well
    and this horse knew it.   I have
    never had a horse not work with me.
      It may take some time but every
    horse comes around if they know you
    know.<br>
    <br>
    If I worked with this horse I would try and
    make him not want to flip over, that would
    probably force me to have him try and maybe
    actually flip over, at the point I would make
    this horse dislike flipping over.
      I did now see you ride, but MOST
    EVERYONE on a horse that rears, pulls on the
    reins for balance and safety and end up
    pulling a horse over on them.
      Horses do not like flipping over,
    it hurts them and they are not able to run
    and defend themselves.   I would
    make sure the horse realized this and make
    him NOT want to flip over.   You
    don't have to be on him to do this.
      You strap a couple of tires on
    the saddle, you can tie a feed bad that is
    heavy on the saddle, you can lots of things
    to get this horse to learn that flipping over
    only gets him grief and bad times, but it can
    be dangerous for the horse, but he has to
    learn that flipping is not acceptable and if
    you make him scared to do it, great, if you
    make him worried about doing, so what.
      You can tie him high with a good
    rope halter where he can't flip over if he
    ties, you can have him so controlled on the
    ground and so responsive to the lunge rope,
    that you can pressure him to rear and then
    make him run, make him learn that when he
    front feet leave the ground he gets hard fast
    pressure.   If he lets you get on
    and off "100 times" as you say, it makes me
    think he does not know the forward command or
    forward cue, so he rears out of confusion.
      Your explanation is less that
    specific, is he rearing from fear, from
    resistance, from confusion, does he warn,
    does he rear a few times before going over,
    does he back up first, does he know how to
    back up, did he have a bit, were you wearing
    spurs, what did you do, did you pull on one
    rein or one rein, did he fall straight back
    or to the side, did you pull his head to the
    side, did you jump off, did you stay on, did
    he land on you, where were when he hit, what
    did you do after wards, only about a 100
    questions that I don't know and each one
    could change the answer.   If I
    emailed my doctor and said I was in a wreck
    and got hurt can you help me, my doctor would
    not have a clue.   The fact that
    you don't realize this, tells me you don't
    know as much about horses as you tell me you
    know.   Another factor is I see
    things differently than other people, you
    could have ten good horsemen watch a horse
    wreck and probably each one would describe it
    differently and would see different things
    and see different causes and see different
    fixes.   Some or all may be right
    or wrong.   Just another reason
    that not a lot of people do this and try and
    help, it is frustrating to the questioner and
    the person trying to help.<br>
    <br>
    ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------<br>
    <br>
    QUESTION: ok, maybe I did not explain myself
    right because you are saying things that I
    already know.   When I acquired the
    horse, he was a wreck, he allowed me to ride
    him and he was ok but strong and very spooky,
    he did seem as though he had been cowboy
    broke to me.   He did some bucking
    and then did some rearing so I took him back
    to basics.   If he heard a man's
    voice or a man or another woman came near me
    while I was working with him, he would
    strike.   I am sure you could work
    with him, he will trust anyone I think that
    puts the time in.   I am just the
    only one who has given him the time so far.
      As far as me pulling on the reins
    when he goes up, that did not happen.
      I gave him his head completely.
      He started to twist and I knew we
    were in trouble.   I let him sit
    and figured he needed a little more play time
    and ground work.   Started back to
    the beginning with sacking him out, then
    lunging with the saddle, then the saddle and
    bridle, let him put himself on the bit,
    desensitizing with the saddle, I did some
    liberty work with him as well, got him to
    change directions on cue with just moving my
    hands.   He is great with all of
    that.   I then mount and dismount
    without having him move at all, took my time
    then tried to get him to move forward with
    just a click and light leg and up he went.
      I have a very light hand.
      I then say to myself well maybe
    he just needs more time.   I give
    him a break then start over again.
      I have restarted this horse every
    spring since I got him and am getting no
    where.   I have 3 other horses that
    I rescued and they are all fine.
      (by the way, that is what I do, I
    rescue horse, I have rescued 13 in the past 2
    yrs and got them healthy then gave them to
    suitable homes) Maybe it is me...
      but I have trained x race horses
    from the track, problem horses in the past
    and started 2 yr olds with no problem that
    did not even so much as buck after my ground
    work.   I dont understand this guy.
      I am not saying I am an expert, I
    sure made my share of mistakes but not on
    this guy.   I gave him a chance
    that no one else would.   I have
    had trainers come out here and tell me that
    he is completly right handed, scared of his
    own shadow and that I should get not ride him
    or let anyone else.   I should send
    him out to Perelli or Anderson.   I
    have kept him because of the way he is and
    was afraid of what someone else might do to
    him. I do not need you to respond to this, I
    just wanted to explain the situation in full
    because I obviously did not explain it
    correctly the first two times. Answer:OK,
    first this is not about you or me being an
    expert.   This is about a horse
    that has been screwed up by people and needs
    help.   As far as other horses,
    that does not matter either.   I
    have worked lots of horses and could get
    killed tomorrow by a horse.   I
    tell people all the time, the horse will tell
    you if you know what you are doing.
      This horse is telling you, that
    you don't know.   It is not
    personal, it just is. You say maybe it is
    your fault, I assure you something is your
    fault, when something goes wrong when I am
    handling a horse, I assure you it is my
    fault.   Knowing and accepting that
    is first step to growing and progressing your
    horsemanship.   Looking for others
    to blame or horses to blame is a sure way
    never to grow, plenty of those types out
    there.   So, I still this as part
    you. You say you rode him, he allowed you to
    ride him and he appeared cowboy broke.
      So that tells me the horse did
    not rear and flip over until you started your
    training program.   Since I assume
    that you said he let you ride him, which
    means he did go forward and move, without
    flipping back.   Each time you tell
    me he did something, you said you stopped and
    went back to ground work, that tells me that
    the horse learned by rearing, you would not
    ride him.   You also said when you
    rode him he would strike at other people that
    came up to you, again this tells me you were
    riding him and he was not flipping over,
    which brings me back to this was taught and
    learned, since he did not do in your first
    rides.   If you are too worried
    about this not being you, you did not do it,
    it is not your fault, you cannot change what
    you, you do not know what you do, therefore
    you do the same thing and the horse does the
    same thing.   If you want change
    from your horse, YOU need to change, if you
    are so convinced that you do nothing wrong,
    then how can you change, in your mind there
    is nothing to change.   I can't
    help people that are dead set on being right
    or set on nothing they did ever causes
    anything bad.   From your three
    emails, you continue to take that position.
      You say you don't understand this
    guy, he is a horse, he is saying the same
    thing about you, he does not understand you,
    he says it the only way he can, you say it
    with words.   You are not seeing
    this as a YOU issue, you keeping wanting to
    make this a horse that was abused, a horse
    that hates men, a horse that can't learn
    since you did everything right and did not
    cause any of this.   You are not
    seeing this as this horse sees it, you see as
    you see it.   That is not
    horsemanship.   <br>
    <br>
    Nothing you have told me is new, nothing you
    said is unique, all horses will do and have
    done what you are explaining.
      This horse is trying to tell you
    something and you are too busy, being good at
    ground work, good at breaking other horses,
    good at starting 2 yr olds, good at rescuing
    other horses, and this horse is screaming
    that you are not that good, you need to try
    something different, he needs your help in
    other ways than you have tried, so you, being
    human, with pride ego and knowledge, want to
    look everywhere for an answer except to
    yourself and this horse.   This
    horse will teach you if you stop and listen.
      You may be too busy, you may not
    have the time or patience, whatever the
    reason, it does not sound like you are
    committed to helping this horse fix this, you
    may be good at giving him a home, food and
    good ground work, but that is not what this
    horse needs.   He sounds like a
    project and if you don't have the time then
    fighting it or trying something every six
    month or every year is not fair.
      You say the horse is scared of of
    his own shadow, that tells me the horse feels
    insecure, he does not have a leader, he is
    not being given direction, he is not being
    taught to deal with his fear.   You
    say you were told he is right handed (I think
    you are referring to right
    brained/reactionary) and not left brained
    logic and thinking.   So what, all
    horses are right brained that is how they are
    born and survive in the wild, they have to be
    taught how to think and use their left brain,
    they have to be shown how to not react
    instinctively so they can learn.
      Once again when people want to
    point and tell me all the problems with a
    horse it tells me that they do not understand
    horses and they do not know as much as they
    think.<br>
    <br>
    There is much more about horses that I don't
    know than I know.   I say that and
    other good horsemen understand that and know
    what I mean. Others, who don't know horses,
    hear that and think well why are you giving
    advice, why are you passing yourself off as
    an expert, you must not know much.
      I often ask people to rate them
    self between one and ten, with ten being the
    highest, as to their knowledge of horses.
      Most everyone I ask, rate them
    self as a 8 or 9.   Then they ask
    me, what do you rate yourself at and I say a
    3 or 4.   Then I get the look like
    I have two heads.<br>
    <br>
    Horsemanship is about the horse, not you or
    me.   So you say you should send
    this horse to Parelli or Clint, I would guess
    they get offers of untrainable horses every
    day.   Since you find homes for
    other horses, let this horse be a horse and
    find him a good home.   You gave me
    some information but you did not answer one
    important question.   Why the long
    break, why four years and now this needs to
    be fixed, what else is going on and why would
    you expect some new change after your four
    year ownership?</p><br>

    <p>Question:   I read your last
    answer about using a bosal instead of a
    snaffle and found it very informative.
      I am not a horse trainer. I
    understand why you don't answer many
    questions anymore and respect that, and won't
    get nasty if you decide not to answer this
    one.   I know someone who has a
    young filly who is not trained, a three 1/2
    year old that is very strong willed and
    throwing her head when she tries to lead and
    teach her ground manners.   She has
    hired a trainer that is using a metal bosal
    on her which she says helps. But, she also
    mentioned that the filly responded to bathing
    and grooming very positively by the trainer
    as well. Other than your article, I saw
    several blogs and comments of people that
    said that metal bosals can damage and scar a
    horse if not used with care and in
    experienced hands.   Is a metal
    bosal necessary at all?   Thanks
    regardless of the answer.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Absolutely no reason to use a
    metal bosal and anyone that does is not a
    horseman. If I wrap barbed wire about a
    horse's head I could control most any horse,
    that does make anything but an A**.
      What is being described as strong
    willed is nothing more than a young horse
    that has not been taught or handled properly.
    On my bad horsemanship page of my site I
    discuss many stupid practices such as this
    and they are all cruel in my book.<br>
    <br>
    Not sure how you can help this situation, but
    your instinct are right to me. Anything can
    scar or damage a horse, the old saying, any
    bit is only as painful or aggressive as the
    hands that hold it. The problem with this is
    people think they are soft and not hurting,
    they are wrong. If I have rely on any pain
    device to control a horse I should not be
    riding that horse.<br>
    <br>
    This so called trainer is someone who does
    not understand this and knows that when all
    else fails you can hurt and pain a horse into
    submission, so those who don't know or
    understand horses use these stupid
    devices.<br>
    <br>
    I have taken many horses out of bits, shanks
    and all kind of crazy things and the horses
    do just fine and much better in just a simple
    rope halter.   Horses are fear
    animals, so when you add pain you justify the
    fear and only make learning impossible for
    the horse.<br>
    <br>
    Would a dancer have any beauty if you had to
    use a whip or spurs to get them to dance?
      The problem is this trainer does
    not know, the owner does not know and now the
    horse has to pay.<br>
    <br>
    "In the land of the blind, the man with one
    eye is king". Many horse people are blind of
    knowledge, so anyone that comes long with one
    eye is suddenly king.<br>
    <br>
    Not sure if this helps, unless you can take
    this horse from it's current situation.</p>

    <p>Question: I recently acquired a 13yrold
    pony, who was once broke but was left for
    pasture for 2yrs.   I have been
    working with him for 2 months. I am sure the
    past owners never lunged him because he was
    scared of it.   I put away the
    whip, he was also scared of it.   I
    have him lunging for about 1/2 both ways and
    he is starting to respond with walk, trot, ho
    only a occasionally he tries to take me for a
    run which he does not get away with.
      I have a 7yr old that rides him.
      He rides well when I am by him
    but as soon as I back away he runs as fast as
    he can back to his barn.   Now she
    is scared, he is scared. She tried to stop
    him but could not.   Is a riding
    pasture or circle my only option? or should I
    just have him follow me around the yard as I
    am doing now?? Thank you for your help.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: You should learn more about horses
    before this horse hurts your child and you.
    You say the horse was broke? says who? the
    person that wanted you to buy it? A pony is
    the most neglected horse out there. Read my
    website, I have lot of examples on many
    things that you don't see right now.<br>
    <br>
    A child on a pony is normally an accident
    looking for a place to happen. Take the time
    and read my site completely, it will help you
    see things differently.<br>

    QUESTION: This pony I have been around for
    10yrs. He was ridden by 3 girls all the time
    and then they grew up and left him in his
    pasture until I took him.   <br>
    I have read and will keep reading. Your
    answer certainly doesn't give me any advice
    to proceed forward, reading which I continue
    to do and paitently trying to spend time with
    this pony. My daughter wears a helmet an we
    try to spend 1-2hrs a day with him with
    caring paitence with discipline.
      I was only looking for advice on
    riding arena maybe a better option but all
    you seem to wanna do is discourage us.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: I do not want to discourage you, I
    don't want to try and give you advice when I
    don't know what is going on. You, like
    others, always want to fire back with
    additional info that I somehow should have
    know. I am not a mind reader.
      From what you wrote(that is all I
    have to go on) I gave you my advice. From
    that you want to blame me for discouraging
    you.   This proves my point and is
    probably exactly why you are having problems
    with this pony.   <br>
    <br>
    You write me a 6 sentence question and expect
    me to come up with some fix for problems that
    you have,your child has,this pony has and
    since I don't tell you some feel good answer,
    NOW, I am discouraging you.<br>
    <br>
    Whatever, here you go, here is my new answer
    and should have been my first answer.
      Without seeing the horse or you,
    I cannot properly give you reasonable advise.
    I suggest you hire a local trainer who more
    qualified to help.<br>
    <br>
    Ok, feel better, I hope that is more
    'encouraging'.</p>

    <p>Question:   Hi- I have a 5 yr
    old qh gelding. He is very social, and yet
    when getting him out in the open, he gets
    testy. I roundpen him first trying to get the
    energy out-he does not do much in the
    paddock. He is alone, but has neighboring
    buddies, occassionally they will run, but my
    horse is on the lazy side. In the round pen
    he does quite well, knowing walk,trot,
    canter(sometimes hard to get into-and may
    buck) and whoa. When I get him out in the
    open, including out in the 40 acre field, he
    gets some energy bursts, and will get testy.
    He may put his head down as far as possible,
    and you have to pull to get it up, then he
    gets fiesty. If you try to get him to canter,
    he may buck. A trainer can push him right out
    of it, is firm, but she says he is a good
    horse-not mean-just playful and testy. His
    health, teeth, and equipment have been
    checked, and are good. He was ridden in a
    full cheek snaffle-even with curb chain, and
    I needed more control out in the open. Now we
    are going to try a mild curb, with shanks
    that move around. I cannot figure him out. WE
    have taken him out thru the heavy woods, and
    he goes over, branches, small logs etc, fine.
    I have had tree branches with leaves I put
    all over his body, while he trys to eat the
    leaves, have had a colorful large umbrella
    over him-no problem-he justs lowers his head,
    and rests, has gone over tarps fine, etc. But
    he frustrates me with his antics. The trainer
    says when you make him work, he gets ticky,
    and you have to make him do it. I ordered him
    smart calm ultra in hopes of leveling out his
    moods. He may just act up-prancy at times-for
    no apparent good reason. To trainer also, and
    she is firm, and has no fear. He gets mainly
    hay, and 1/2# safechoice morning and night. I
    am getting frustrated, as I want a solid
    level headed horse I can trust. He seems to
    have 2 different personalities. I know he
    likes variety, and he gets it. I hope he will
    out grow, what I think is immaturity, and I
    hope with this supplement he will focus on us
    better. I only had him about 7 months, and I
    couldn't do much with him at all, at our old
    stable-as the pasture buddies were very
    agressive, and he came to the new stable in
    June with many marks. We had to wait on a
    waiting list to move. His body has recovered
    from that per checkup, but it has only been
    since the summer he has really been worked.
    He is a very social horse always comes to
    meet me, great in stall, curious, but the
    other personality, gets me frustrated. I am
    told he is smart, but as I said he even is
    alittle testy to the trainer. thankyou.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer:   ......I am just
    shaking my head reading your question. Partly
    for the horse and partly for you. Obviously
    you have not read my web site or any of my
    other answers. If I had to explain what most
    people think, that do not have a clue about
    horses, it would be this email. You addressed
    everything from food, location, other horses,
    trainers, stalls, supplements, called the
    horse names like testy/has different
    personalities/lazy/feisty/antics/immature,
    you are blaming the horse for most all the
    issues and now you are going to a more
    painful bit that hurts the horse more with
    less pressure from you and your hands.<br>
    <br>
    If I did not know better I would swear that
    your email is from someone that knows me and
    it was written as a joke to get me riled
    up.<br>
    <br>
    Tact is not my strong suit, so I call it like
    I see. You are not paying me and you asked.
    You do not have a clue about a horse. You are
    doing just about everything in the world that
    I think is wrong. You are paying a trainer to
    try and train your horse when you should be
    training yourself. You are the problem not
    this horse. You and this horse are destined
    to fail if you do not accept this.<br>
    <br>
    You admitted that your trainer is firm and
    fearless, that tells me that you are NOT firm
    and you are scared, both teach a horse to be
    dangerous. Your trainer is using nice words
    and making it sound nice as to not hurt your
    feelings. I think she is doing you and the
    horse a disservice. I see this all too often.
      People like me who are more
    direct, rude, mean, up front, or whatever you
    or others want to call it, do not make
    friends or have lots of people that want to
    pay someone to tell them they are doing
    stupid dangerous things that will likely get
    them hurt, or of more concern to me, get a
    horse hurt. I make it clear I do what I do
    for the horse, not money and not for people.
      Most trainers I see, mainly
    women, will be their clients friend, will
    talk and spend time laughing and handing out
    all the time taking money for months and
    years from people that don't have a clue
    about horses.<br>
    <br>
    There is one lady at a previous barn that
    bought a horse that she was scared of, the
    horse was broke and was ridden before, yet
    this person paid for lessons every week for
    over two years and never rode or got on this
    horse. But her and her trainer "liked" each
    other, they went slow, they hugged after each
    lesson, laughed and cried together.
      Meanwhile the horse never
    respected either and was confused and
    frustrated all the time.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site, read my articles, what the
    training videos and learn "the horse". Once
    you figure out you are the problem, then you
    will start to grow with this horse and stop
    trying to fix this horse. Your horse is just
    a horse and that is all he knows how to be. I
    cannot teach a life time of horse knowledge
    in one email. My site is long and it only
    scratches the surface of a horse. I really
    hope you read my site for your horse's
    sake.</p>

    <p>QUESTION:   I have been training
    an Arabian gelding for about a year now. He
    will be 4 in Feb. The very first time I got
    on, I was over confident and got bucked off.
    He did not try it again for several rides,
    but when he did, I came off a second time. I
    have ridden him several more times, (without
    coming off again, yet) but I am concerned
    about pushing him too fast, and causing
    another blow-up (next time, I might get
    hurt!)At the same time, I wonder if I am
    being too soft on him, and going too
    slowly.<br>
    <br>
    so here are the particulars:<br>
    the first ride, I used a mounting block. I
    had my (in-experienced) boyfriend holding the
    lead rope. (my first mistake) Once in the
    saddle, I realized I was wearing my tennis
    shoes instead of boots (second mistake) I
    decided not to put my feet in the stirrups
    (third mistake) then changed my mind (fourth
    mistake) and bent forward- while the
    boyfriend was leading the horse at a walk- to
    adjust the stirrups. Couldn't quite find the
    stirrup, and kicked the horse in the process,
    and of course, he bucked. Tipped forward like
    that, I never had a chance. My boyfriend
    dislocated a finger trying to hold on.<br>
    <br>
    Before you get the wrong impression of me, I
    have been riding for nearly 30 years and even
    have a degree in Horsemanship. In all those
    years, I can only count the number of times I
    have been bucked off on one hand, and I have
    never been bucked off a green horse in
    training before! I knew I was making all of
    the mistakes above, as I made them- as I
    said, I was over confident.<br>
    <br>
    OK, second incident: Everything was going
    smooth as silk. I had ridden the horse
    several times in the round pen, and once or
    twice in the pasture. I was in the pasture,
    and was able to encourage him gently into the
    trot for the first time. Made a smooth
    transition back down to the walk, and decided
    that was a good note to end on. As I turned
    back to the barn, the horse's sister called
    out to him. He picked the trot back up, and I
    gently used my hand and seat to say "no
    trotting towards the barn". He didn't like
    that, and bucked. I hung on for several
    bucks, and attempted to pull his head up with
    one rein. But he was so strong, I was unable
    to bend his neck, and finally came off.
    (Wound up with serious rope burn!)<br>
    <br>
    So the (above) second incident was about 3
    months ago, and we are still just walking.
    Part of the reason for this is my own
    apprehension- I don't want to get hurt. But
    part of it is the horse does tend to have an
    emotional outburst if he feels I am pushing
    him. We do lots of ground work: round pen
    where he will follow me like a puppy,
    lunging, some ground driving as well as just
    walking around on the lead line and working
    on lateral movements as well as backing. He
    will back, turn on the forehand and leg yield
    with me in the saddle, as well. I have been
    making sure that his sister is visible when
    ever I ride, for fear of her calling to him
    again. It is my gut belief that his bond with
    his half sister (they are only 4 days apart)
    is my underlying problem. Even though he
    seems to accept my dominance, he has what I
    see as an unhealthy bond with her, always
    checking to see where she is. I do not have
    the facilities to completely separate them,
    nor do I want to "get rid" of either
    animal.<br>
    <br>
    So there are a couple of questions here: am I
    taking it too slow? How could I decrease his
    separation anxiety? The bridle I am using is
    a bitless nylon "side-pull" (he has carried a
    bit, but does not do well with it). Is there
    another piece of equipment (a bosal, perhaps)
    which may give me more leverage when trying
    to bend his neck during a buck?<br>
    <br>
    Feel free to take your time answering- I am
    not opposed to just walking and lunging for
    the next several weeks! And if you want more
    info, I promise to not be so wordy in my next
    communication to you! Thank You!!<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: lol, not at your bucking but at your
    explanation. I think I am the Gordon Ramsey
    or Simon Cowell of the horse world. If you
    know these people you know they piss people
    off with their honesty and no pulling punches
    style of giving feedback. So grab a chair and
    hang on.<br>
    <br>
    OK, first incident, you could not have done
    more wrong if tried (maybe?). You did not
    think it out, you got in a hurry, you were
    lazy and you took shortcuts instead of taking
    the time it takes and you set the horse up to
    fail and he went right were you led him. So
    admitting this if great, but the damage you
    did was so huge that I don't think you get
    it. Your actions taught this horse he can get
    you off, now you make him smarter, you taught
    him something that he did not know before you
    did what you did. So fine and dandy that you
    know what you did, and fine that you know it
    was your fault, and fine that you are not
    blaming the horse, but NOT fine that you
    taught this horse a dangerous lesson and now
    your have to go so far back and try and
    un-teach this.   Much harder than
    just doing it right the first time. Having
    your inexperienced boyfriend hold the rope
    was the least of your problems.
      So knowing you were wrong is not
    near as good as not doing something that you
    know is wrong.   BTW, giving me
    your resume means nothing to me or the horse,
    if you were as good and have as much good
    experience as you say, you would not have
    done what you did and would not be in the
    situation you are in now. A good
    horseman/horsewoman will not tell you what
    they know, they can show you. You showed this
    horse, and maybe yourself, that you are not
    as good as you may have thought.<br>
    <br>
    Second incident: This has nothing to do with
    his sister.   Let me say that
    again, it had nothing to do with her, or the
    wind, or the pasture, or the barn, or the
    grass blowing......it is YOU. It sounds like
    you want to explain away what happens so it
    does not have to be you. Sorry, it is you.
    You did bad so the horse did bad, you set the
    horse up to fail and he did.<br>
    <br>
    If you have read any of my answers or my
    site, you would know blaming the other horse
    or making excuses on why this happen means
    nothing.   What matters is what the
    horse learned and what you taught the horse.
      On the first "incident" (your
    training session) you taught the horse you
    were not a good leader, you let someone
    without confidence try and lead and control
    him, you taught him that he did not have to
    let you ride or sit on him, you taught him
    that he is stronger than you and the guy
    holding him, you taught him that he can get
    you off when he wants, you taught him not to
    trust you, you taught him that you are not a
    smarter or strong leader and that he should
    not put his life in your hands.
      And that is just some of what
    this horse learned by your hand. In the
    second "incident" (bad training lesson) you
    taught the horse that it does not have to
    listen to you, it can run when it wants to
    and you can't stop him, you taught him (in
    case he did not learn it the first time) that
    he can get you off when he wants, that you
    can't control him when you are on his back
    and that you are not a strong leader that he
    should trust. (no boyfriend factor in this
    incident - tell him that since I am pretty
    sure he got some of the blame in the first
    incident)   :)<br>
    <br>
    NOW to what you learned, since I think I made
    it clear what the horse learned. If you think
    this is bits, barns, sisters, boyfriends,
    shoes, separation anxiety or whatever else,
    then you learned nothing. What you should
    have learned is you did not do many things
    right, you did things wrong, you did not set
    this horse up to succeed and that this horse
    is not going to let someone, that does not
    know, lead him (you). He is a smart boy that
    will teach you more than all the other horses
    put together, if you don't let him kill you
    first.<br>
    <br>
    It seems by your questions that you are NOW,
    worried about getting hurt( and your actions
    have made it more likely that you will be
    hurt). A little late and now  the
    horse knows it, not good.   It
    sounds like you are going too slow now and
    being over cautious and the horse knows. You
    need to understand horses better. I say this
    since your explanation tells me that you
    don't understand horses.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page and a few of my
    articles and review the answers (on the
    question and answer page about bucking) so
    you have some foundation on where I come from
    and where horses come from.<br>
    <br>
    If you are still confused on what to do next,
    write me back and I give you a few things.
    Unless you understand how me and the horse
    see things, you cannot apply what I would
    tell you, effectively.<br>
    <br>
    Go do some reading and get back to me. (go
    give your horse a carrot and tell him thanks
    for the lesson, he just made you better, in
    case you did not know it)<br>

    boyfriend not then, not now: he is still
    perfect, I blame me, just as you do. Sorry if
    I did not make that clear in the first
    place... so how can I save/fix the
    relationship with the horse?)</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: I don't know, I only know what I
    read in your question. I do not think you
    have read my site or your question would not
    say what it does. But if I am wrong, then you
    did not get what I say in my site so not
    worth explaining it again.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck,</p>

    <p>Question: Hi, my question is a simple
    question. I went to the website and i
    couldn't find it. I've been trying to figure
    out what kind of horse do I have. He is grey
    and has like little dots (can't explain it
    they're like light brown/yellowish little
    dots) Any little help that you can give me
    will be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Yea, you won't find much on breeds
    on my site. I would say you have an official
    horse and that is about as close as I can
    get. It could be part anything, I don't see
    any strong specific breed jumping out at me,
    but I am not into breeds, bloodline and stuff
    so not the best person to ask on this. I am
    firm believer that a good never comes in a
    bad color or bad breed. His head could be
    little mustang, the spots could be the start
    of what some call flee bitten and may be more
    as he gets older. Horses commonly change
    coat, color, spots, so no telling, younger
    horses change more that older.<br>
    <br>
    I did notice the web halter (yuck) and the
    buckle on the lead rope (not good), but the
    horse looks great to me. A little shorter
    back than some like, I like short backs. Even
    Mustangs caught and branded are not really a
    breed since many let many different types of
    horses go so cross breeding is common.<br>
    <br>
    My comments about the halter and rope will
    make sense if you read my rope halter
    page.<br>
    <br>
    sorry can't be more help,<br>

    <p>Question: I have a question about my horse
    Chief. I have been riding for a very long
    time so I am pretty knowledgeable about
    horses, but he confuses me. He will not turn!
    He will turn at the walk, but at the trot or
    canter he will just plow on, and no matter
    how much I use leg aids, kick, and pull on
    the reins, he won't listen. He also has
    issues with respect. Every time I try to wash
    him, he walks into me instead of backing up
    like most horses I have worked with, which is
    dangerous to me and everyone else that tries
    to work with him. I have done numerous
    exercises on him but am at a dead end. Please
    help? Thanks,<br>
    Magenta</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: You did not tell me how long you
    owned this horse and how long have you been
    riding him. What ever you are doing is either
    causing it, not preventing it and allowing
    the horse to do this is only teaching him
    that he can do it.   Do some One
    rein riding so you learn to control the horse
    without a bit, pain or fear, then ride the
    horse in a small area, best if you have a
    round pen.   You have to teach the
    horse what you want and then show the horse
    how to give it to you.<br>
    <br>
    I have a video on one rein riding.

    <p>Question: My daughter has a 16 year old
    thorobred mare that is the love of her life.
    She does high school rodeo with her. we have
    had her for 3 yrs now and she still wants to
    run past the end pole when she does this
    event. We have been to clinics, changed tack
    and most recent I sent her to horsemanship
    training for 3 days. She works with this mare
    religously 3-5 days a week. She has made the
    changes that the trainer showed her and works
    on them daily. We spend hours working on this
    and have yet to come up with the right
    formula to make this work. Slow work is fine
    the problem is when she lets her run. The
    horse is very well behaved and is a easy
    keeper her disposition is outstanding and she
    is very smart. She is also used to barrel
    race too.   Any help here would be
    greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: You answered this question by
    asking it. There is a saying that goes
    "practice does not make perfect, only perfect
    practice makes perfect".   All the
    work in the world will not work if it is done
    incorrectly.   You explain this as
    if you think I can explain it to you and you
    can explain it to your daughter. That does
    not work with horses.   They are
    too observant and smart and they know if you
    know so if you try and trick or try some
    gimmick or some special thing, a horse will
    always know, if you know if you don't.<br>
    <br>
    This horse knows your daughter does not know.
    How can you think I could somehow tell you
    something over an email, when people who can
    see the horse and your daughter and know 100
    times more info than me, cannot fix this.
      I understand you are lost, I know
    you are looking and trying, but a horse does
    not care about any of that.<br>
    <br>
    Your daughter is not a horseman/horsewoman,
    she in it to win. She uses her horse to go
    faster and win. There is never much
    horsemanship in most horse sports and time
    and awards is a horse's worst enemy.
      <br>
    <br>
    This horse has learned what it does since it
    was taught this by your daughter for the past
    three years. You will not find anyone who can
    fix what you are seeing as a problem.
      I see a poor horse that is being
    used, confused and pushed by a young child
    that has no idea about understanding a horse
    and enjoying the partnership and relationship
    of a horse.   I am not saying your
    daughter is mean or bad, just that she is
    where most kids are at, at that age and
    sometimes this is caused by over zealous
    parents who push competitiveness too much and
    then the child is forced to do what they do
    and then the horse is forced to do what it
    does.<br>
    <br>
    If I had a race horse that raced every few
    days on a track for three years and all this
    horse knows is to run as fast as it can
    around a track with a jockey on top hitting
    him and yelling to make it go faster, and
    then I suddenly wanted to teach that horse to
    go slow, stop, turn and pay attention to me,
    this would not happen overnight, it would
    happen if I continued to do the same thing
    and it would happen if I did not understand
    horses.   <br>
    <br>
    This could be fixed but it would require more
    work and time working on what you want and
    less time doing what it has been doing.
      And I can't control either one of
    those, so I don't think I can help this
    horse.</p>

    <p>Question:QUESTION: Hi Rick,<br>
    I hope you can help us with this.
      We rescued a saddlebred mare who
    was destined to slaughter.   She is
    22 years old but in great shape for age.
      She had been a show horse and
    then sold to the Amish.   She seems
    petrified most of the time. She clacks her
    teeth in submission when we put her halter
    on.   She literally shakes in fear
    when the farrier and vet come out and seems
    to shut down with a glazed look in her eyes.
      Is there anything we can do to
    help her overcome whatever must have happened
    to her. She is a pasture companion we don't
    intend to use her for anything else but we'd
    like for her to enjoy the rest of her life at
    least.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Unfortunately this story is told too
    often. The more I work with horse from Amish
    the more I am convinced they are the cruelest
    and worst horseman in the world.<br>
    <br>
    Glad you are going to give this horse a good
    home.   Time will heal and fix
    this.   This horse has learned to
    fear and submit to humans in a slave and
    master relationship. It will take time but it
    will happen.   Spend time with this
    horse, reading a book, sitting in with her,
    grooming, giving carrots and treats. Don't
    require much of her until she begins to
    trust, but be aware that if she starts to get
    bossy, pushy or threatening, you will have to
    be firm and make her move her feet, but don't
    over do it.   <br>
    <br>
    The more time you spend just hanging out and
    not requiring anything, she will start to
    relax and trust.   So pick her
    feet, rub her, give her treats, stand next to
    her and be near her, she will forgive.
      Horses are really good at
    forgiving and trusting, that is why they are
    abused so often.<br>
    <br>
    That glazed look you describe is fear,
    nervousness and insecurity caused by stupid
    a** people that think the only way to train
    or handle a horse is with brute force and
    fear (AKA Amish).<br>
    <br>
    When you say pasture companion, I hope you
    have a second horse, this horse really needs
    to be with another horse, to bond, trust,
    herd up and feel safe.<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps,</p>

    <p>QUESTION: Hey Rick- I just wrote to you
    about my yearling kicking. I was just now
    looking around the internet again and found
    your response to the person with the kicking
    feeding problem. It would have been
    entertaining if I didn't know that I was the
    dumdum in this senario. Well, I'm thinking
    while I read it, oooh, that's me going to get
    my fool head kicked off and I don't mind
    admitting I am an idiot when it comes to
    this. I have no experience training a young
    horse- obviously- but I do know a few things.
    One is that she doesn't respect me, another
    is that I don't think beating her with a
    stick is a very good option, but you are
    right, it is a very dangerous situation.
    Please do tell me what would you do- a young
    horse is frightened and wants back in the
    pasture with mama and tries to whirl around
    and kick you? It is very scary to me-
    although I did hold on, twice, and for
    discipline, had no stick but snapped her
    halter and backed her up- not so much but
    didn't know what else to do as the storm was
    literally coming in. How would you go about
    getting a yearling to respect and admire you?
    My dogs are very well trained, the mare
    responds to me well, this is a totally new
    area for me. Thanks again!<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Well, you got me on this one, most
    people ignore what I tell them and tell me
    how it is not them and it is the horse after
    they read my answer. You are asking me
    another question before I answer your first
    question.<br>
    <br>
    Please allow me to answer your questions
    first so then you can ignore it.
      lol   :)<br>
    <br>
    only kidding, but some truth in it.<br>
    <br>
    As I just answered your first questions, read
    it, try and understand it and read my site,
    articles and other info so you can better
    understand horses, so you can get better.
      If you stop concentrating on how
    good your dogs are and how you had horses
    before and how...bla bla bla....<br>
    <br>
    None of that matters to a horse. As soon as
    you admit that you are the problem, you don't
    know as much as you think you know,
    especially about horses, then you can be open
    to learn from the horse.   The
    horse is best teacher of the horse.<br>
    <br>
    I often ask people I work with to rate their
    horse knowledge from a one to ten, one
    knowing very little and 10 knowing a lot and
    most everything.   Most people rate
    themselves at a 7 or 8. Some of these people,
    the smarter ones, ask me where do I rate
    myself on the that scale. And my answer
    always gets me looks like I have two heads.
      I rate myself at a 3 or 4.
      Some say well shit I am higher
    than that, why am I asking you for help.
      Others realize that if I am as
    good as I am with horses and I am only a 3 or
    4, there must be a whole lot to know and
    learn.   Those people I can work
    with, the first group, most people who think
    they are eights, will get hurt, will buy and
    sell horses, will blame horses, will get
    horses hurt, will pay trainers, will end up
    getting out of horse or will have nothing but
    a frustrating life always fighting, training,
    trying and failing with horses.<br>
    <br>
    You have a choices on every path, a horse
    does not. They are stuck where they are and
    who they are with. Which is why, "it is never
    the horse's fault".<br>

    QUESTION: Hey Rick- Thank you so much for
    answering. I should have waited for a
    response the first time- you're right, but I
    honestly didn't think you would write back
    since you were a little peeved at people's
    questions. I did read off your website and
    learned a ton. Listen, I have no problem
    knowing I'm like a zero or one with training
    a young horse. I've probably graduated to a
    one. I do watch my ego and try to not let it
    get in the way- I am frustrated because I
    want to do a good job and not get hurt and I
    feel like I should know what to do, but I
    don't. That first kick was bad, I had owned
    her for 5 minutes at that point and I almost
    got sent to the hospital. I guess I had hoped
    that she forgot, but no such luck. I think I
    can learn and I think I can do it. The mom
    horse is not such a good teacher because the
    baby actually pushes her out of the way. I
    spend a lot of time pushing the baby out of
    my way. No more carrots. No more in my space
    at all. Hips away from me. Feet moving.
    Trying to get the baby in with a different
    mare who will be more bossy. Okay, yes, I
    wish there was a magic potion, and you could
    tell me exactly what to do, but mostly I
    wanted to thank you for taking your time to
    answer me.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer:   No need to thank me,
    do right by your horse. Read you last
    response you wrote again. Horses are a
    mindset. All the answers and problems come
    from us and what we do.   Your last
    response still is seeing this as the mom is
    not a good leader since she lets her horse
    push (I assure you no human is better at
    being a horse, than a horse), it does not
    matter how mom treats the young one, it only
    matters what YOU do. You say you are
    frustrated, I assure you that your horse is
    more frustrated. You say that you are looking
    for a more bossy mare for the young one, it
    does not matter what another horse does with
    that colt, it only matters what YOU do. YOU
    YOU YOU, this is why horses make us better.
      They challenge us, they identify
    our weakness and force us to work on them,
    they test us, they make sure we are on our A
    game all the time and if we are not they let
    us know. STOP looking for other reasons for
    this horse's behavior, it is not the mom, it
    is not another horse, it is not what someone
    else did, it is not from
    neglect........<br>
    <br>
    It is you and when you get better, your horse
    will get better. If I or another good
    horseman handled this horse, you would see a
    different horse.   All horses are
    just horses, since the day they are born.
      A bad horse is never born it is
    made... by people that don't know.<br>
    <br>
    You don't know it yet but this horse is going
    to teach you more about horses (and yourself)
    than any person every could, but you have to
    listen and be willing and stop trying to make
    it about something else. It is just you and
    this horse, and if the horse fails you
    failed, if the horse is good then you are
    good, a horse is only the reflection of the
    person handling it.   It is not
    easy and it is not fast, it is hard work with
    NO short cuts. Once you accept this the
    frustration will turn into joy of learning
    and being taught and in the presence of one a
    the greatest animals on the earth.<br>
    <br>
    If it was easy everyone would be good at
    it.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: Hi Rick- I have a Hanov./Tb 11
    yr old mare. We've been spending the past 2
    years I've owned her undoing her previous
    owner's damage. She's a very sensitive mare
    and has no problem moving forward and was
    basically rushed through her training to jump
    as high as she could as fast as possible. She
    was trained as a jumper/dressage horse. I am
    currently eventing with her and with time and
    patience, she's become an excellent partner.
    She has solid 2nd level dressage training.
    But her previous owner skipped a lot of steps
    in her training. She is very good on the
    lunge but I have one problem that I need help
    figuring out. First off she is petrified of
    the dressage whip. Since she is very
    sensitive I can do most everything with just
    a slight movement of my hand and slight
    movements of the end of the lunge line to cue
    her to move forward, but if I ever try to use
    a lunge whip, or even have one in my hand
    while lunging, she takes off thinking she's
    supposed to run as fast as she can in a
    circle. The minute I drop it, she settles. As
    you can guess, not being able to use the whip
    is limiting my lunging. One problem I have is
    getting her to move out on the circle. She
    tends to fall in from time to time creating
    slack in the lunge line. But if I point at
    her shoulder with even my hand to move out,
    she thinks I'm asking her to go and she
    speeds up. I can't even get to that point
    with a whip in hand. So I guess what I'm
    asking is, how do I get her over her fear of
    the whip, and how do I teach her to move out
    on the circle and that the whip doesn't
    always mean speed up?<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: First, I do not use a whip to lunge
    a horse, I don't promote it, think it is
    needed and think too many people use since
    they do not know what they are doing. Your
    horse has these issues for that very reason.
    She was chased with a whip (called it
    lunging) and now has learned that a whip
    means I run or I get hit, chased or
    whipped.<br>
    <br>
    This is not a whip issue, not a horse issue,
    -- yep you guessed it, it is a you issue. You
    using the fear of the whip as an excuse since
    you don't understand what your horse is
    telling you. Your horse is screaming to you
    and since you don't hear her, are not
    listening, don't understand her,
      you are seeing this as an abuse
    issue issue, prior bad training issue.
      I could get this horse to ignore
    the whip in about 20 mins. So you are
    thinking, then just tell me what to do so I
    can do it. It is not that simple and can't be
    done.   YOU have learn to think and
    understand horses in order to be able to fix
    this. I can teach you that in an email.
      The fact that you and others
    write me questions and expect and think that
    I can someone how tell you a "fix" tells me
    that you don't understand horses.
      I can only try and get you to
    admit this so you can decide and accept that
    you are the problem and when you fix you,
    your horse gets better.<br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: Well, I guess thanks, but first of
    all, if you read my question, I clearly
    stated I didn't use the whip since I did
    recognize her fear and chose not to use it.
    Second of all, in using the whip I simply
    wanted to use it as most dressage riders do,
    as an extension of my arm to ask her to move
    away from me and teach her that it will not
    be used to hurt her or chase her, not to
    strike some kind of fear into her. I have
    never once hit my horse with anything, chased
    her with it, or even threatened to do so, so
    I am frankly quite shocked you would accuse
    me of that especially since I clearly stated
    that the instant I saw her fear I stopped
    even holding it in my hand. I don't use one
    when I ride either. So, I think I listen to
    what my horse tells me very well. If you read
    my last sentence, I was asking you if you
    could help me with some techniques to help me
    help her understand that it won't be used for
    that purpose, and how I can train her to move
    away from me on the lunge, with or without
    the lunge whip. I wasn't asking for some kind
    of   "FIX", or accusing my horse of
    having a problem, and if you get so irritated
    with people asking for help
    training/retraining their horses, then I
    suggest you not be a part of this website.
    So, obviously you completely misunderstood my
    entire question. Maybe I wasn't clear in my
    question, but I hope you understand my
    intention was never to use the whip in any
    malicious way.I don't even care if I never
    use it. I'm quite happy not using it. I just
    know from previous experiences, it can be
    helpful in a way as an extension of your arm
    to cue the horse for what you want them to do
    ie: move away from you, make a circle bigger.
    So I apologize if this is all a
    misunderstanding, but I think you should read
    more closely to what the question is before
    jumping to conclusions.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: OK you're right, the horse is not
    telling you anything, I misunderstood your
    question, I did not listen, you are doing
    absolutely everything right and this must be
    a horse issue, after all YOU have working
    with this horse for two years and it just
    can't learn, so it must be the horse.<br>
    <br>
    Silly me, jumping to conclusions.<br>

    QUESTION: Wow Rick, I was shocked when I read
    your response to this horse owner's question
    as I was doing a search for some information.
      It was incredibly obvious this
    was a conscientious, caring owner trying to
    get some direction about how to communicate
    with her horse.   If you read her
    questions, she never once blamed her horse,
    only the way people handled the horse before
    her.   How mature of her to
    recognize that.   What a shame
    professionals belittle and judge people with
    such honest intentions instead of encouraging
    them and leading on the right path.
      I'm sure Liz would benefit from
    some one on one training from an expert.
      You'd certainly benefit from the
    same on how to communicate with people in a
    constructive way. Answer:Thanks for your
    input and not to put too fine a point on it,
    I don't care about your opinion either. I do
    this to help horses and people are the main
    problem with horses. I can't help a horse
    when a owner whats to make excuses, blame
    others, come up with a hundred and one
    reasons on why it is not them. There are
    plenty of other people who will give feel
    good advice. 95% of all horse issues are
    owner issues, until a person accepts that
    fact - I can't help them and I don't want to
    waste my time. So if I offend someone who is
    making a mistake with a 1000 pound animal
    that can kill them, others or cause the horse
    to kill himself, frankly I care. I volunteer
    my time and experience, I know what I am
    doing and I give the best advice I can. I
    have a web site with over 400 pages of FREE
    information and that only scratches the
    surface of horses, so when people rush out
    buy a horse and then want to write someone on
    the internet to solve all their horse
    problems in an email, I don't have time to
    give them a lifetime of education. I direct
    them to my site, I make information available
    and do what I can. What I won't do is get
    into an discussion about excuse, blame, how
    it is not them or other things. I assure you
    no one hurts me by not asking me a
    question.<br>
    <br>
    What you and others don't see is the nice
    letters I get from people that take my
    advice, read my site, educate themselves and
    then write me on how my information changed
    their relationship with their horse and they
    finally realize that they were causing all
    the problems and now they have just a great
    understanding relationship with their horse.
    Then I know I have helped "a horse" have a
    better life. The fact that a human benefited
    is of less concern to me.<br>
    <br>
    So feel free to add yourself to the list of
    people that don't like my advice. Funny thing
    about life, there are normally two sides to a
    fence and most people choose what side they
    stand on.</p>

    <p>Question: After many years away from
    horses, I have recently inherited a 16 month
    old filly and a ten yr old mare- her mother,
    both arabs of good descent. I grew up on
    arabs and am very confident upon the horse,
    in any situation I can think of, including
    shying, running, rearing, bucking....but have
    little experience on the ground. I have been
    working with the filly, using natural
    horsemanship techniques I have learned from
    reading and from friends, and we seem to be
    getting a good relationship going. The very
    first day she came, she had never been out of
    her birth pasture, was sent over night on a
    semi with the mom, came out and freaked out-
    she ended up catching me off guard and
    spinning around and kicking me- a shoulder
    hit and I flew to the ground. That was 3
    months ago. We have gained confidence and
    trust until last night, when I was working
    her a bit outside of her pasture, in the
    round pen- just learning how to lead out off
    a hand cue, to eventually lunge. She is a
    smart one, and learns quickly. Anyway, the
    weather was changing and she was freaking out
    and wanted back in the pasture, rearing up,
    then twice trying to spin around and kick me.
    Not the get you in the knee kick, but high in
    the air, get you in the head kick. In all the
    years I was on the farm with our 5 arabs, I
    had never, ever experienced or heard of one
    of them kicking at a person. I can't really
    afford a trainer, but want the best for both
    of us. I also thin kthis is a potentially
    very dangerous situation. I can try to sell
    the mare to pay for some help. She is a good
    filly, but I am losing confidence in my long
    term commitment and would like to know if you
    think this is a normal reaction to a
    perceived scary situation? and do you think
    that we can overcome this. On the positive
    side, I didn't get kicked as I was holding
    her properly, and we were successful on
    getting across the compound back to the
    pasture while she was nervous. I am not petty
    and I promise not to complain about your
    answer. My dream has been to get back into
    horses and I love how smart she is. I am
    worried that I will be afraid of her and that
    will impair my ability to train her. Thank
    you, I really appreciate any help.</p>

    <p>Answer:   This horse is being a
    normal horse. Anytime you handle a horse it
    is dangerous, a lot of people just don't know
    the danger. This little on is
      teaching you, so learn well. A
    does not care how much you know, how
    experienced you are or how many other horses
    you have owned. They are all about survival,
    fear, safety and a leader. You are right she
    kicked you since she caught you off guard,
    you were not paying attention, you were not
    ready, you did not set her up for success,
    you did not help her succeed, she kicked you,
    it was your fault and now the horse has to
    pay. The pays by learning a bad habit, by
    learning she can kick a human now, by
    learning that you don't know what you are
    doing. Everything you do with a horse you
    have to look at what you teaching and what
    the horse is learning. You teach good habits
    or bad habits. Kicking you is a bad habit,
    you taught it, you did not prevent it, you
    did allowed it happen and now the horse
    knows.<br>
    <br>
    The horse does not need a trainer, you do. I
    always tell people work on yourself and your
    horse will get better. You are thinking since
    you have experience that this horse cares, it
    does not. A horse evaluates you every time
    you handle it or are around it. So
    experience, knowledge, ego, ribbons, awards,
    won prizes mean nothing to a horse. It cares
    if you can control its feet, if you are in
    charge, if you are a good leader and if you
    can keep it safe. A horse will test you and
    if you fail (you failed when you got kicked)
    then they get smarter and lose confidence in
    you.<br>
    <br>
    Please don't try and justify this as a horse
    issue, as a mom issue, as a buddy sour issue,
    as a poor abused neglected horse issue, not
    matter what anyone tells you or what you
    think, I assure you, this is a YOU issue. So
    you either learn and get better or you buy,
    sell, find a trainer, take bad advice, listen
    to anyone that will talk to you or get out of
    horses.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is being a normal horse doing
    normal horse things and unfortunately you are
    being a human, smart, experienced human doing
    normal human things.   Until you
    become more horse, learn to think, act,
    understand and talk to horse, it will not
    work, the horse will win, you will get hurt,
    the horse will pay.<br>
    <br>
    There many more people that have gotten out
    of horses than are into to horses. That does
    not happen by chance.<br>
    <br>
    So read my site, read books, spend time the
    horse learning and not just teaching, watch
    the mom talk to the horse and learn their
    language. I have lots of info on my site, if
    you make the time to learn so you can help
    these horses and in the end you will get more
    than you give.<br>

    <p>Question:Hi Rick,<br>
    <br>
    I rescued an OTTB gelding about a year ago.
      He is the son of Holy Bull -
    grandson of Storm Cat.   He is a
    beautiful, strong and the smartest horse I've
    ever had.   The problem is my
    leadership skills with him.   He is
    very different than my other horses in that
    he is aloof and dominate.   Can you
    tell me the best way to improve on my skills
    so I can help him learn to trust people and
    be happy just being a horse?   He
    is turned out 24/7 and has the best of
    nutrition and vet care I just can't seem to
    bond with him.   Right now I am
    doing Parelli natural horsemanship with him
    which has helped a bit but he still wants to
    bite, strike and just be generally cranky at
    times.   Will he ever be able to
    bond with a person?   I could not
    love him more so I want to do what's best for
    him.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you</p><br>

    <p>Answer: Bloodlines, moms and dads don't
    mean anything to a horse or me, only people
    want to add some value to that.
      All horses are strong, smart and
    beautiful. So this tells me that you have not
    had many horses and really don't understand
    them.   Parelli should help, but
    the problem is you. You think this horse
    cares that you love him, he does not.
      A horse wants a strong leader so
    it can relax. You are more worried about
    being this horse's friend, so you are being
    nice and think you are being kind. You are
    confusing the horse, you are not giving good
    direction, you are not being a strong leader,
    you are not showing this horse that you are
    someone the he should listen to or respect,
    so he treats you like a lower horse.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page, treat this horse
    like a lower horse, you need to be the strong
    higher horse or this horse will never love,
    like or respect you.<br>

    <p>Question: reply:<br>
    You are right.   I just spent the
    day with my horse concentrating on thinking
    like a lead horse.   I think I was
    pitying him. All the horror stories I had
    heard about the lives of racehorses and what
    they endure made me feel sorry for him.
      He doesn't need that.
      The other horses in our herd
    don't feel sorry for him,he's just another
    horse. They see him as a leader and their
    security. So I have to let the past go and be
    his leader so that he can feel secure.
      Thanks<br>
    BTW- Taking my sunglasses off helped too.
      Good advise on your website.</p>

    <p>Answer: Good, glad I can help. Keep
    reading and learning, understanding these
    guys is a life long journey and they are
    always teaching us, so don't forget.

    <p>Question: What is your stance on the
    slaughter of horses.</p>

    <p>Answer: I discuss this on my site. I have
    a slaughter video link on my bad horsemanship
    page. The short answer is people cause it,
    people do it and horses pay for it. I would
    rather see a horse starve in the wild than
    killed in a cruel, mean and fearful
    manner.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site and you will understand why I
    say what I say and why I believe what I
    believe.<br>
    <br>
    And the old story about can't feed them and
    too many, I say the same thing applies to
    many children and we don't slaughter them
    after they are born anyway.<br>
    <br>
    As always, horses pay for people's mistakes.
    It is never the horse's fault.<br>

    <p>Question:   I have a very sweet
    mare that I am starting. She is just 3 years
    old. She is very respectful and is very
    responsive to verbal commands and ground
    training. The problem is that she has an
    aweful buck. I have only saddled her and have
    not mounted her yet, but once I cinch her up
    she is fine until she starts moving at a trot
    or faster. Then she bucks so big and so hard
    that she is dangerous. I cannot stay in the
    round-pen or indoor arena with her because
    she doesn't respect my space the way she
    normally does on the ground without a saddle.
    Do you have any suggestions?</p>

    <p>Answer: Read my site and learn to
    understand a horse. You do not understand
    horses or you would not use sweet mare and
    that you can't stay in the round pen with
    this horse since she does not respect
    you.<br>
    <br>
    You are right, she may be very sweet and she
    does not respect you, but this is not a horse
    problem.   You need to educate
    yourself so you can think like a horse,
    understand a horse, learn how to talk to a
    horse in horse language and understand why
    horses do what they do.<br>
    <br>
    Your horse is being normal.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Question: I went to your sight and read
    what you said about turning horses out
    together, which is great and the way you
    should do it, but where I am the problem is
    I'm afraid if I put them together they will
    kick and break a leg or something else will
    happen to them. I have 4 horses on 1/2 acre.
    I turn them out 2 at a time, the ones that
    get along. I recently got a horse that I put
    in a pen next to another horse and he pawed
    the fence until the next morning he was three
    legged. Vet said it was like smashing your
    hand in a car door. When it is his turn to go
    out in the horse trap, he stands at the gates
    of the other horses and shows his teeth and
    tosses his head up and down and he hit the
    gate and got a big knee from it. He is well
    now, but I guess my question is will he hurt
    my other horses if I turn him loose with
    them? I know is silly, but I really want to
    get him happy! Thank You</p>

    <p>Answer: All horses fight, kick and bite,
    it is what they do. The fence causes more
    aggressiveness and increases their will to
    fight and dominate.   feed them
    well, throw 8 to 10 piles of hay in the area,
    not too close and not by fence on in corners
    and then let them go.   Yes one may
    get a broke leg, one may get bit, and they
    will fight, but if you have gotten rid of
    corners and taken away the will to fight for
    food, then the initial fights will be less.
      You can alos round pen and
    exercise the aggressive horse until it is
    very tired and then it will be less worried
    about fighting if it is tired.<br>
    <br>
    Your horses, your choice, I have done and
    seen it done 1000 times, maybe once a horse
    got hurt and it was because of fence and
    corner.   What ever you do STAY OUT
    IT, and don't try and save or help or get
    involved, put in the area and leave so they
    will not run to you or pay attention to you,
    they need to pay attention to the other
    horses.<br>

    <p>Question:   Have a horse here
    older(16) unbroke mustang. Taught him to lead
    and do groundwork pick up feet etc.
      He is the most questioning and
    fearful horse of the mustangs and others I
    have ever worked.   Trailer loading
    came so I could get him to my place.
      I do reward for forward and keep
    them focused on the trailer.   I
    spent 8 hours just easing this horse into the
    trailer(ramp) which I don't care much for
    anyway.   Goes in now but backs out
    immediately. I am practicing tying skills
    outside now and working behind him but he
    never pulls or spooks outside. Thought I
    might put him in a box stall and make that
    his trailer to practice with. He stays in
    longer with me than when I ask him to load in
    the trailer by himself.   He is
    tall and I don't want him to smack his head
    as his ears almost touch anyway.
      The trailer is a nice open
    3-horse slant.   I have opened all
    the windows and tried first and second hole
    but the reaction is the same.   I
    spend literally hours trying to get another
    second of stay time and I always try to back
    him out before he comes out by himself.
      I have to work by myself.
      Any suggestions.   I
    feel he is just so fearful and possibly
    claustrophobic.   The owner loaded
    him years ago in a fire emergency by having
    two people one pulling and one beating
    behind. I hate that.   But he goes
    in fine now just won't stay.   Any
    other ideas very appreciated.   I
    load him twice a day regular halter and
    lead-no chains or knots or sticks, to try to
    get him more comfortable with time.
      Thanks</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: All horses are claustrophobic. If
    I put you in a trailer, locked you up and
    drove around you would not like it either.
      Horses don't like to be ridden,
    don't like saddle, don't like nails in their
    feet, don't like to be tied up, but they do
    it.   <br>
    <br>
    Stop trying to get him to stay in.
      Load him half way and then YOU
    decide to back him out, load him two steps in
    and YOU decide to back him out, let him leave
    the trailer 50 times and he will learn he
    will get out if he goes in.   8
    hours is way too long and You are sending
    messages that you are worried about the
    trailer, you are fearful of what can happen,
    you are making him more nervous by worrying
    about his nervousness.   <br>
    <br>
    Load and unload him 15 times and make it your
    idea to back him out, on the 16th time just
    relax and ignore him for 5 secs, then back
    him out and then SLOWLY move up a few seconds
    from there.   Don't go from 5 secs
    and then ask for 30 secs or the horse will
    leave when he wants, any time he wants to
    leave the trailer, make him leave and make it
    your idea, soon he will like not having to
    leave.<br>
    <br>
    This is a you issue and not a horse
    issue.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>QUESTION: We loaded the horses in our 4
    horse stock trailer today and headed to the
    mountains to trail ride. This is the second
    time these horses have been in this trailer.
    We put the smaller horse in the front and the
    larger behind. About 5 miles into our trip
    the smaller horse broke loose and flipped out
    causing the larger horse behind to get
    spooked and flip out as well. Anyway, by the
    time we got stopped and to the trailer both
    horses were on the floor. Large one on the
    bottom wedged sideways with her neck bent and
    smaller horse across her backend on the
    floor. We quickly got the lead ropes loose
    and the small horse jumped up while the
    larger horse laided there for a few seconds
    until we jumped in there and got her to her
    feet. Everyone was ok with a few scrapes and
    bumps. We tied small horse to the back with
    little slack in the rope and larger horse in
    the front. Another mile down the road I see
    large horse going down. She pulled back until
    she passed out. She has done this in the past
    being tied to a tube/post. It ruined our day
    and we ended up turning around before
    anything else happened and to get a better
    look at the larger horse as we weren't quite
    sure why she went down the second time. When
    we got home...they both were fine and have
    been roaming their pasture just as they
    normally do. The little horse also has a
    problem with standing tied and will rear up
    if there is any resistance or if she doesn't
    want to go in the direction you want her to.
    I've only had her for a short time. I'm
    thinking about a "BE NICE HALTER' or
    something of the sort. But the freaking out
    in the trailer has me worried and I'm afraid
    to load them up to go again. I was planning
    on taking them on a 10 mile trail ride to a
    forest service cabin for a couple of days (an
    hour drive) next weekend and now I'm afraid.
    I have never been so scared in my life and
    really thought the larger horse was dying and
    had a broken leg the way she was down in the
    trailer. Thank God it wasn't...things could
    have been a lot worse than what they were and
    I never want that to happen again. Any adice
    would be greatly appreciated.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: OK, I always take the horse's side,
    so here is where I tell you what you did
    wrong and how you caused all of this. Your
    horses do not have a problem, they were set
    up to fail by you, yes I know not
    intentionally but intentions do not matter to
    horses.   You did not teach these
    horses how to tie properly, you did not use
    good halters and ropes or they would not have
    got away, you did not tie them properly or
    they would not have got away, you did not tie
    them to a strong enough tie point or they
    would not have got away.   No
    matter how you look at it, you caused what
    happened.<br>
    <br>
    Had you done it right this would not have
    happened. Had you taken more time this would
    not have happened, had you understood horses
    better this would not have happened.... all
    horse problems are people problems.
      Your horse could not have been
    hurt or put in this situation without
    you...<br>
    <br>
    So you can stop with the feel bad, worried,
    ruined my day or however else you want to see
    this.. you caused it, you did not prevent it,
    you did not prepare the horse properly and
    like always the horse had to pay for your
    mistakes.<br>
    <br>
    I have no idea what a "be nice halter" is but
    by the name someone created it so it would
    sound nice and appeal to people that don't
    know any better. See, you want to see this as
    a horse issues and you are looking for an
    easy fast fix. Which is why you will
    continued to put your horses in danger.
      The fix is YOU.   When
    you do right your horse will do right.
      When understand horses you will
    be able to predict things like this, when you
    take the time it takes you will know that it
    takes less time.   <br>
    <br>
    This is a you problem so fix yourself and
    your horse will get better. Read my
    horsemanship page, my rope halter page and my
    tying a horse page.   Then if you
    can't figure out what you need to do write me
    back.<br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: Thank you for your answer. I agree
    that it is my fault and that I led my horses
    to failure due to ignorance and not
    understanding horses better. I'm not looking
    for an easy fix. I'm trying to evaluate the
    situation and prevent this from ever
    happening again. Many things (standing tied
    for one) that we need to work on. I've also
    started to feed them out of this new trailer
    to get them use to it a little more. Hoping
    it will decrease the fear of the trailer.
      <br>
    <br>
    The "be nice halters" or "anti-pull halters"
    are the type of halters that apply pressure
    when a horse pulls back. They are not halters
    that you throw on a horse and think your
    problems are solved...I understand that! The
    horse will need to be taught to move forward
    to release pressure and so on. I'm not sure
    if these will work with my little Arab as
    when she feels any threat she will back up,
    rear and fight until she feels release then
    she stops. Especially if she does not want to
    do something (i.e. cross bridge when being
    led). She has never reared when I'm on
    her...only when leading her. She will do the
    backing up and spinning around bit when I'm
    on her which I don't like and have been
    working hard to correct with her. I've
    noticed it is when she doesn't want to go in
    the direction (away from home (herd) usually)
    when we ride out from our home. We usually go
    in circles to stop the backing up and
    redirect until she goes in the direction I
    want her to. As I said before, I haven't had
    her for very long and am learning quickly
    about her.   <br>
    <br>
    I will read your entire site and search for
    answers to help our situation and to
    especially improve my horsemanship!!! I'm in
    no way shape or form an expert at this...but
    working at it. Thanks so much for making the
    info available and for answering e-mail. Your
    service, even if it's not entirely what a
    person wants to hear is more valuable than
    you'll ever know.  </p>

    <p>Answer: Well, glad to hear that you are
    accepting responsibility and not blaming the
    horse. You have just taken a big step to
    improve your horsemanship. Your horse does
    not see you as a strong leader, all the
    things you are seeing is a lack of respect,
    maybe some fear, from the lack of
    trust/respect. If this horse saw you as a
    fair firm leader, she would not be testing
    you by stopping, pulling back, rearing and
    other non-sense. I could take this horse and
    that behavior would stop in about less than 5
    mins.   Not tooting my horn, just
    that I would show the horse, I am leader, I
    can make you move and feel uncomfortable, I
    can stop your movement, I can make you stop,
    I can control where you move, as soon as the
    horse saw that, all this resistance would go
    away.   My guess is you are being
    too nice, too easy, not consistent and giving
    bad direction.   All of this tells
    a horse, don't trust this person, this person
    is not a good leader, I better test this
    person every time to make sure she really
    knows what she wants and to make her prove to
    me that she really is the leader.
      Every test you fail, you tell the
    horse it was right, every test you pass, you
    tell the horse you are leader.
      <br>
    <br>
    A horse that rears only does so when someone
    is pulling on their head, only people that
    pull on a horse and make them rear, don't
    know what they are doing, so they don't know
    how to change what they do. No human can out
    pull a horse, but a small child can attack
    the butt of a horse and make a horse move
    away and in a circle or back up.
      If this horse rears, she needs to
    be backing up fast and fearful and you need
    to be chasing her backwards for 5 feet or so.
      A few of those lessons and this
    horse will quickly figure out that rearing is
    NOT the right answer and rearing only makes
    me get chased backwards and that is not fun
    and I don't want to do that.   You
    need to understand a horse to know how a
    horse thinks so you can "think like a horse"
    and then you will see big changes.<br>
    <br>
    Read the site, read the articles, watch the
    training vids, visit the links I suggest, "as
    you get better, your horse will get
    better".<br>

    <p>Question:Hi,<br>
    I have read the site, its brilliant and I am
    totally prepared for you to tell me I am
    stupid and have made some major mistakes but
    I really need some honest advice so here we
    go...<br>
    I have a yearling, QH cross,which is pretty
    unusual since I am in England...love her to
    bits but she started weaving last summer when
    she was weaned. We have american barn type
    stables, so a weave grate isnt really
    possible and I know thats not the real
    solution but I really dont want her to ruin
    her joints, or form more of a habit, so this
    weaving lark has to stop.<br>
    <br>
    I kept a horse in the block with her, but she
    still weaves over any fence/door when she
    wants "something". She will weave if she is
    not near her mother, my riding horse and she
    will weave if you walk away from the
    fence/gate after leting her go. She will
    weave when she runs out of hay, or in
    anticipation of food in at meal times. I
    thought a summer on the grass with other
    youngsters might help but I have recently
    brought her home to try and heal the sunburn
    scabs on her heels (not easy) and the problem
    has errupted again. I have not got a mirror,
    someone said I should try this, but because
    she doesnt weave when she doesnt think you're
    looking (I have spied on her) or if there is
    no "temptation" the other side of a fence, I
    have been loath to pay so much for a
    stainless steel mirror.<br>
    <br>
    I do not want to tell her off for weaving, I
    do not want to get a weave grate and ignore
    the problem, but I do not want a horse with
    joint problems and one that will be weaving
    for the next 20+ years (it grates on my
    nerves to see her, especially since she does
    it so fast it makes me feel sea-sick!). So
    you see, I really dont want to conrinue doing
    things wrong...but I dont know what to
    actually do?!<br>
    <br>
    Oh, dont know if this is useful info but she
    is super pushy, I try to be firm but when I
    walk away in the field she will do that
    stroppy face, rearing, trotty thing she used
    to do when her mother would walk away when
    she wanted milk...I am not her mother but I
    have a hard time making her believe it, which
    is sweet but also I can see the potential
    danger. I need to set boundaries, but she
    seems to ignore my efforts.<br>
      </p>

    <p>Answer: My guess is you weaned her..why do
    people do this, who cares if a horse is with
    their mom. I just don't get it and this is a
    woman thing since guys could care less if a
    baby hangs out with mom.   You did
    this too soon and now you have created this
    habit since you felt the need to take a young
    horse from it's mom.   The mirror
    thing and other tricks would not be needed if
    you let horses be horses.   Put the
    horse with it's mom and let it be a horse.
      This really pisses me off to hear
    this.   This poor horse is being
    kept alone and has now developed a bad habit
    that will hurt it for the rest of it's life,
    all because People, you or others have this
    crazy obsessive need to wean a baby.
      When people stay out of it,
    horses do fine. I really don't want to hear
    all your good reasons for weaning this horse,
    you caused this problem and now you want to
    "feel" bad or be annoyed.   What
    about this poor horse, maybe it was not ready
    to be ripped away from mom, maybe it was
    scared and insecure and felt abandoned and it
    had to do something to adjust to this
    loneliness-- all caused by people wanting to
    wean.<br>
    <br>
    Put the horse in pasture, put the horse with
    its mom and stay out of horse saving. Other
    horses will fix this it PEOPLE stay out of
    it.   Your comment about worrying
    about joints later is irritating to me.
      What about what this horse is
    going through and feeling and living every
    day, you are worried about joints.. it just
    amazes me how people can claim to care about
    horses and then do what they do to
    horses.<br>
    <br>
    YOU have done enough, put the horse with
    horses and stay out of it.   That
    is my take. I always take the
    horse €™s side, so forget
    how you feel and think like a horse.</p>

    <p>Question: I have a 4 year old paint
    gelding who won't give me his head in the
    round pen.   He will transitions
    wonderfully, stops and looks, but I can't get
    him to yield his head once he is stopped.
      I walk up, then back-up hoping he
    will turn his head my way, but nope.
      He is very calm, not at all mean,
    and generally very mellow.   I was
    in the round pen with him for almost 2 hours,
    I tried making him move out at an extended
    trot or canter hoping he would realize it
    requires a whole lot less energy to submit,
    but once again nope.   Any
    suggestions?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks</p>

    <p>Answer: what ever you are doing you are
    doing it wrong.   The horse is
    telling you this since he is not giving you
    the right answer.   You are
    probably not releasing correctly with proper
    timing.   Two hours is way too long
    to round pen, you are going to cause leg and
    joint problems for the horse, horses are not
    made to run in circles.   You are
    chasing and not teaching or training the
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page, I go into round
    penning, but without seeing what you are
    doing I cant be specific, but I assure you if
    you do it right the horse will do it
    right.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Question: My horse is 5 years old and very
    calm and easy to ride. She is so unreactive
    that she totally ignores the electric fencing
    and just pushes right thru it to get to the
    grass or cornfield.I am afraid she will
    wander too far to the road and/or get hurt as
    sometimes it takes me over an hour to find
    her. Can you recommend any training or other
    options on fencing to keep her in? She is a
    little dense and just doesn't get it. Now a
    second horse has picked up the trick and I
    have two to find. Helpl. I don't want to have
    to get rid of her as the kids can ride her
    safely, but I also can't keep tracking her
    down.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: This is not a horse issue.
      Someone, maybe you, did not put
    up a good enough fence to make sure the horse
    did not learn this behavior, so now that the
    horse has been allowed to learn it, you want
    to blame the horse for being dense. Had you
    put up a proper fence or stronger shocking
    fence you would not have set this horse up to
    fail.<br>
    <br>
    Your hot wire is probably intermittent, which
    means it is not hot all the time. Run it so
    it is hot all the time, also run a pipe or
    wooded fence so it can not just break the hot
    wire easy.   I am only guessing but
    I bet you tired to take the easy way, not put
    up real fence and decided to cheat and just
    put up a hot wire thinking it would work.
      All bad decision on your part and
    the horse has to pay now.   Which
    is why it is never the horse's fault.<br>
    <br>
    So invest the time and money you should have
    and put up a good sturdy fence and then run a
    hot wire on it, so the horse will learn
    proper behavior to keep it safe.</p>

    <p>Question: Hi Rick, I have a retired
    standardbred mare who sometimes turns her
    head (her left eye and ear facing the
    ground)when I'm riding her. It is usually
    when I am pushing her away from the other
    horses though she has done it when following
    her best paddock companion when trotting up a
    fairly steep hill towards home.<br>
    <br>
    She does have a hunters bump though the vet
    said she is in no pain.   On the
    lunge she bucks and kicks out if pushed hard,
    though no head turning.<br>
    <br>
    In the paddock she does a sort of loop head
    shake only occassionally and usually when the
    horses are moving to another area or if she
    is waiting to get through a gate.<br>
    <br>
    I am wondering if you think I'm doing
    someting that is troubling her?<br>
    thanks for your time<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>Answer: Not sure, couuld be a kink in
    neck, could be a dominate eye things, could
    be that is her good and her other eye is
    going bad, could be an inner ear
    issue/infection, could be neck or top line
    imbalance, without more info can't say.
      Studs will shake head back and
    forth to gain attention or to show dominance,
    so could be take off of that behavior.
      If it is not medical, then you
    are probably causing it, but you have to try
    and get her do it under the same
    circumstances and then you can tell if it is
    learned or pain or medical or habit or
    reisitance.   bucking when pushed
    could be direspect/lack of respect or pain,
    so not sure on that or if they are
    connected.<br>
    <br>
    Try and isolate the behavior and then isolate
    the varibles so you can pin it down better
    then figure how to deal with it.<br>

    <p>QUESTION: What is your opinion about when
    it is OK to ride a horse with pain issues.
      I have been riding a 9 yo TB that
    was started on the track and then moved to
    intensive jumper training only to "lose his
    mind" and become "dangerous".   He
    had some time off in pasture and then I began
    riding him.   He has not been
    dangerous at all, but perhaps a bit
    distrustful and I sense is stiff in all the
    leg joints and neck, as well as having a
    little back pain (though the back seems to be
    his least issue)   I have been
    riding him about two months now, three times
    per week, about 30 minutes each time, some
    trail, some arena.   He has become
    my buddy, more mentally relaxed, but his back
    pain has increased some, and I don't know how
    to evaluate joint pain.   I will be
    meeting with his vet soon to ask.
      I know that ground work and
    befriending him have been good for him, and
    he is much more willing and relaxed under
    saddle already, but because his back pain has
    increased (the saddle was custom, and really
    seems to fit), I just don't know if it's more
    good than bad or more bad than good to ride
    him?   I ride a few other horses as
    well and wonder in general if a horse has
    even a little back pain, would you say not to
    ride him at all?<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: If your back hurt would you want or
    like to give piggyback rides?
      Probably not.   Jumping
    the most painful and damaging thing you can
    do to a horse.   It is very
    unnatural, it puts enormous about pressure on
    the front legs and back and a does not do it
    in the unless it gets caught where it has
    too, so then you add the weight of the a
    rider, saddle and landing on only two legs
    and you do damage every jump.<br>
    <br>
    Get on top of a table and jump off, you will
    land on two feet now get back on and jump off
    and only land on one foot, do not use the
    other foot, it hurts.   You put a
    1000 pound horse who normally supports their
    weight on four feet, then you add a riders
    weight and then you make them land on only
    half their feet and can't wonder why the
    horse is in pain.<br>
    <br>
    You did not say how much you weigh so that is
    a factor, how thick is you saddle pad, what
    type of saddle (eng or west), is the horse
    shod or bare foot..all factors relating to
    the pain.<br>
    <br>
    Bottom like, treat a horse the way you would
    want to be treated, if you sprained you ankle
    and made you run, the pain may not be that
    bad, but I am sure you would not like it,
    would be happy with me making you run and
    would enjoy or think it was fun.<br>

    QUESTION: The TB is not being jumped anymore
    and I dismount on the trail on long
    downhills.   My relationship with
    him is strictly one of learning and
    companionship.   We just do short
    trail rides and or flat work exercises in the
    arena.   In total: about 30 min per
    session 3x per week.   The thing
    is, his attitude is improving but my guess
    (just based on the way he moves and by
    palpating his back) is that his physical pain
    is not reducing.   I sometimes
    think he really enjoys feeling like he's
    doing something and other times I worry that
    he is physically vulnerable and
    uncomfortable.   So I am torn about
    whether he should be retired from riding
    altogether or whether the "work" has some
    value.   He is shod on the front
    only.   His saddle is english/
    all-purpose and I use a pad with 3/4" foam
    inserts.   I am 150 lbs. Answer:For
    as much are you ride I would get rid of front
    shoes.   Think about putting a
    metal plate in your shoe and walk around.
      Your joints and shins would hurt.
      At 9, for as much as you ride,
    going barefoot will help a lot.
      It may take a while for the horse
    to adjust and grow out but in the long run it
    will be better for horse.<br>
    <br>
    An english saddle puts more weight on horse
    than western.   A western spreads
    out weight more across back, where an english
    spreads it out only across the two side pads.
      Maybe an inch pad would
    help.<br>
    <br>
    Just because you do not jump now, the damage
    was done long ago, you also may not know when
    the horse was started.   If it was
    started at 2 that does damage before a horse
    fully grows, if it came from track, that is
    probably the case.   For your
    weight with a good pad and saddle I would not
    think it would be an issue, but you never
    know, it could have a fracture in the spine
    or on any of it over 200 bones.
      Could have a swelling, cartilage
    build up or other things.<br>
    <br>
    You have decide.   Exercise is good
    and will help build muscle and work muscles,
    but if the horse is in pain then I would not
    do it, but I can't see horse so I can't tell.
      Just do everything you can to
    help and don't do anymore damage.
      What that means depends on what
    you see or learn from vet.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: I have a filly just weaned at 6
    months she has neo natal maladjustment
    syndrome. Signs were not sucking and grinding
    teeth.   I am finding it difficult
    to introduce the lead to her I will attach it
    to her headstall in a large round yard and
    stall but she will only stand in the corner
    of the stall if in the yard she is panicking.
    Lead was placed on in the morning I removed
    it in the evening as she was not progressing.
      Help please<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: What the hell is this syndrome.
      It sounds like a fancy way of
    saying this young filly was abused, handled
    wrong, kept caged up, not allowed to mental
    grow with other horses and people have ruin
    her and made her a horse with a past and no
    future.<br>
    <br>
    Forget the stupid headstall, help the horse.
      Put the horse with other horses
    and let it be for 6 months, they will fix
    what people have screwed up.<br>
    <br>
    And forget the mumbo jumbo fancy talk
    describing what is wrong with the horse and
    let the horse be a horse with other horses.
      Read my horsemanship page on my
    site so you understand horses better.<br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: The syndrome used to be called
    Dummy foal or Wandering Syndrome.
      The foal was born that way.
      In simple terms they lack oxygen
    to the brain whilst being born.
      The filly has another horse with
    her whilst she is being weaned.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: I am sure there are medical things
    that can go wrong with foals. In breeding can
    cause some issues as well.   No
    matter what the cause and no matter what the
    problem.   Being with other horses,
    roaming in open area and not caged or stalled
    is the best thing for any and all problems.
    Horses take care of horses, in the wild the
    stallion may have killed this baby if would
    not make it or hold the herd back, medical
    issues are hard to know for sure with horses
    since they can't talk, explain or tell us
    specifics so all we can do is guess.<br>
    <br>
    My advice is keep the horse with horses so it
    can be a horse and let it learn grow and get
    better with other horses.
      Whatever you are doing does not
    appear to working and people tend to mess up
    more horses than they help and I have NEVER
    seen other horses mess us being horses
    without humans.   Turn it out with
    horses and see what happens in a few months.
      Then if you don't see
    improvement, maybe get back involved, but try
    that first.</p>

    <p>Question: sorry i ask you so many
    questions. ever since i found this sight your
    advice has been very helpful. so thanks for
    reading this.<br>
    <br>
    i have been breaking this mare and she is
    afraid to cross creeks or any water for that
    matter.she wont even follow another horse
    through it. so this is what i have been
    doing. we have a small creek behind are house
    about 3 feet deep in the deepest spots on are
    land i have been walking her through it like
    repeatedly then i would ride her through it a
    couple of times it wasn't as easy as it sound
    it took a lot of patients and each time i
    would have her stand in the middle were it
    was deepest and i would feed her an apple
    wafer. i did this for about 1-1 1/2 hours.
      is this the right way to handle
    this problem will she eventually get over her
    water fears if i keep doing this. or is there
    another way i should be handling it? we also
    have a huge pond should i wade her through
    it?<br>
    Answer: Sounds pretty good to me.
      If it is warm, I would go out
    there during hottest part of day and get off
    her and maybe send her, lunge her a bit,
    just to get her listening and paying
    attention to you, not to get her tired or
    scared.   Then after you get her
    really paying attention to you and listening,
    then you walk in the creek and lunge her
    there.   Make her walk and trot
    both directions, stopping, coming into to
    you, and sending you out a few times.
      This is build her confidence,
    this will get her paying more attention to
    you than the water.<br>
    <br>
    Don't make the focus the water.
      Just like too many people make
    the trailer the focus when they trailer load,
    that makes a horse nervous.
      Always make the focus on you and
    to listen to you, so always have the horse do
    things you know the horse will do.
      Pretty soon the horse will not
    care what it is, it will always know, to
    listen you and you will not hurt it.... so
    don't ever put a horse in position to get
    hurt, but always make a horse pay attention
    to you.<br>
    <br>
    Another thing is work the horse next to the
    creek, have it back up, turn, flex, ride it
    up a few feet turn back a few feet, and then
    only let it rest and relax in the water, soon
    the horse will learn, I get to relax in the
    water... so the water is where I want to
    be... then it will be the horses idea to WANT
    to be in the water and you will not have to
    MAKE it go in the water.   Always
    better when it is the horse's idea, you just
    have to figure how to make it the horse's
    idea.<br>
    <br>
    If you do this twice a day, it will be good
    in a week, if you do it once a day it may not
    be good in 3 weeks and if you do only all day
    on a weekend, it will not be good for
    months.....<br>
    <br>
    Everyday, twice a day builds routine, horse
    like routine since they like to know what is
    going to happen, they find comfort in routing
    and knowing and that builds trust and
    confidence and that is always better than
    fixing something fast....for the horse<br>

    <p>Question: I have an x race horse who is a
    wonderful horse and you would never guess he
    was a racehorse.   I have been
    gaming on him and he is doing awesome except
    one thing.   He really stops on his
    front feet really hard when we stop.
      I always back him up after to try
    and get him to use his hind end, but still
    does it.   Is there any other ways
    to get him to stop on hind and not on front?
      Or am I out of luck.
    Answer:Sounds like the horse might be out of
    luck.   A horse will do anything it
    is taught to do or required to.
      Just because you see this as a
    horse issue, does not make it so.
      This horse was never taught this
    and you need to learn how to teach so you can
    help him understand what you want.
      Him not doing it as nothing to do
    with what he wants.   Without
    seeing this, I can tell if this a rider
    issue, maybe you are setting up the stop
    right, not in the right position, not with
    the right timing, then it could be an old
    injury or the horse has never been taught how
    to stop, race horses run and trot after a
    race and then walk after a trot and then are
    only stopped on a walk.   Since you
    never want a race horse wanting to or
    thinking about stopping it is never taught or
    worked on.   So you want to undo
    all his training to run run run by having him
    back up, it will not work.   I
    always take the horse's side.
      This is not a horse issue, the
    horse does not know what you want, does not
    know how to give it to you and is confused
    and frustrated.   Only you can
    change this.   There is no fast way
    or short answer.   If it is
    important enough for you to want it, then you
    will do what YOU need to do to fix it, read,
    study, learn, and make yourself better and
    your horse will get better.</p>

    <p>Question: hi, my pony Chino runs at me
    with his ears back most of the time after i
    let him off his headcollar/halter and lead
    rope. i get scared but i kind of realise now
    that since he is a stallion he will try to
    fight me because he wants to be leader of the
    pack like they do in the wild, which is me
    &amp; him only i am$ the leader. i no that i
    have to be the leader of the pack and i have
    to tell him off for doing so. i try but he is
    really strong and sometimes i get really
    scared.<br>
    please help me as soon as possible.<br>
    thank you very much</p>

    <p>Answer: The only way the horse knows you
    are a leader is if you show him and act like
    one.   You have to act BIG, sound
    loud, raise your hands, throw a rock, or
    swing a stick at him and make him run off.
      If you move away or act scared he
    thinks he is the leader.   So
    before you take collar off, make him back up,
    make him move away from you, pull his head to
    his butt and show him that you are in charge.
      It sounds like you need an adult
    with you to help you.   This horse
    may hurt you so doing this can get you hurt,
    make sure you ask your parents before you try
    anything and have them watch in case he tries
    to bite you..   This cannot be
    fixed by an email so you need an adult to
    help you.</p>

    <p>Question: I was really looking for someone
    with medical knowledge who could help us.
      If you can't help, I
    understand.<br>
    <br>
    We have an old pony (about 20 years old)
      He is losing weight and can't
    gain any weight no matter how much we feed
    him.   His coat hasn't shed in 2
    seasons.   His stomach is
    contracting all the time and he has become so
    thin.   There are not many vets
    around here that do house calls and we can't
    really afford the expense to pay one to come
    to our home.   <br>
    We have read online about cushings disease,
    but he is not showing all of those symptoms.
      Could you advise us in any way as
    to how to help our "gypsy".
      Thanks for your time.</p>

    <p>Answer: 20 years is not that old.
      Lots of things can cause what you
    are seeing.   Lack of exercise,
    lack of grass hay, bad teeth, not being
    wormed and many others.   As horses
    get older they do not shed or grow hair as
    easy, so grooming is more important to help
    them.   If his feet are not done he
    could be in pain so he walks less, which
    means he eats less and things go down hill
    from there.<br>
    <br>
    If this horse has all the grass hay the can
    eat, a flake of alfalfa once a day, some
    rolled or whole oats (2 - 3 cups a day) some
    rice bran maybe a little sweet feed mixed in,
    this horse will put on weight.   If
    you can't afford a vet, then maybe you are
    not providing enough of the right feed often
    enough.   Also maybe you should
    find the horse a home where a vet is
    available.   Putting on weight is
    not an overnight thing, it may take a few
    months, but just do it slow and don't try and
    do too much too fast or you can kill the
    horse.   <br>
    <br>
    So do this:<br>
    worm the horse<br>
    have the teeth checked<br>
    give lots of grass hay, 2 flakes morning and
    night (grass being Oat, Rye, Orchard,
    etc)<br>
    give alfalfa hay a flake a day, half morning
    half at night<br>
    give 2 cups of oats in morning and 2 cups at
    night<br>
    give 1 cup of rice bran morning and
    night<br>
    <br>
    This horse will gain weight if you do what
    you need to do, you cannot just throw some
    low quality hay out once or twice a day and
    expect that to work.   This horse
    should have hay out all the time so she can
    eat when she wants to and never be hungry and
    never have to wait for food.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: I recently purchased a 5 year
    old Belgian who came to me with poor ground
    manners.   We have been working on
    teaching her that it is not ok to plow over
    humans on the lead and to stand in the cross
    ties, etc.   These things are
    improving, although, she will still test her
    limits.   She has, however, begun
    chasing children who come out to the pasture
    to retrieve their horses.   She
    does not do this to me or other adults.
      She is very large, weighing over
    2000 pounds, and I am concerned with the
    danger of this situation.   Is
    there anything I should focus on in her
    handling to help alleviate this problem.
      I am not in the pasture to do any
    type of intervention when the chasing
    occurs.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Like most problems, this is a people
    problem not a horse problem.   A
    horse will not chase something that does not
    run.   It the child cannot stop a
    horse from chasing it, maybe it should not be
    in the pasture with many horses.
      ONLY the person getting chased
    can stop this, not you.   If you
    are there and do stop it, it means nothing to
    the horse.   A horse will only
    respect someone it has too respect.<br>
    <br>
    You can tell the kid to keep a plastic
    grocery bag in her pocket and when your horse
    comes to shake it over her head at the horse.
      The problem is this is just a
    cheat and does not address the real problem,
    which is the kid that is letting your horse
    chase her, the kid is running from the horse,
    the kid is not showing the horse it can't
    chase her, the kid is causing the horse to
    chase her.   All horses are bigger
    than people, it has nothing to do with size.
      Your horse may also be protecting
    the herd or wanting to play....it is obvious
    that you or the kid being chased does not
    understand horses or the way they think.
      This is perfectly normal horse
    behavior and anyone who understands horse
    would know this.   If a horse
    kicked you when you took his food, you might
    see this as the horse is mean or the horse is
    possess of his food or he has a bad
    habit............   I would say it
    normal horse behavior..   A horse
    is only a horse and that is all it knows how
    to be, this is NOT a horse problem.<br>

    they are and understand them better.<br>

    <br>
    QUESTION: This is both a people problem and a
    horse problem!   I am fully aware
    that this can be normal horse behavior.
      I am also fully aware that it is
    most likely occuring because the child is not
    demonstrating to the horse that she is in
    charge.   However, acting
    disrespectful to any human is not tolerated
    at our stable and this horse needs to learn
    this.   I was simply looking for
    any suggestions you might have to assist this
    h orse in learning that she is always
    sub-ordinate to any human being.
      And size does make a difference.
      This horse is gigantic compared
    to the other horses in the pasture and kids
    who are normally confident in the pasture are
    intimidated by her, as are the adults.
      Even other horses who would
    normally be more dominant in the field are
    intimidated by her.   And she was
    the bottom horse in the pecking order at her
    prior home.   I have lots of
    experience with abused animals and have never
    identified an animal as mean.
      Anyone who works with animals on
    any regular basis would tell you that animals
    act instincively and don't have "mean" in
    their repertoire of behaviors.
      That is purely a human behavior.
    And I could care less if this is "normal"
    horse behavior. It is not acceptable to chase
    people out of your pasture - ever! I have
    reviewed your website.   And I have
    to tell you that you rip on people who call
    their horses names but you do the same thing
    to people!   Telling people they
    obviously don't know anything about horse
    behavior is the same thing as calling their
    horse stupid!   It doesn't provide
    any solutions to the problem.   You
    didn't tell me anything I didn't already
    know.   But thanks anyway.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: OK, you are right, if you know so
    much and are so experienced, then why are
    asking me questions.<br>
    <br>
    This is not a horse problem, we can agree to
    disagree.   I think you are wrong
    and 99% of all horse problems, including this
    one, is a people problem.   This
    horse WILL not chase someone that does not
    run.   And you are on such a high
    horse that you want to get insulted by
    answer.   If you know all that you
    told me you, then why have you not fixed
    this?   If you fix this, write me
    back and please explain how you can train a
    horse not to chase someone when you are not
    there and the other person runs and is scared
    of the horses.   This will be a new
    revelation in horse training.<br>
    <br>
    You response reminds me of an old
    saying:<br>
    <br>
    "It is hard to get down from your high horse
    gracefully."<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>And if you don't like my answers or my web
    site, feel free not to read or ask me
    questions and don't go to my site.
      See that is the wonderful thing

    <p>QUESTION: Hi, im hoping you might have
    some advice for me about my mares lameness.
    About 4 years ago some 'fool' left the field
    gate open and all the horses ran loose around
    the surrounding fields.. my mare came back
    lame on the front left with no obvious reason
    (no cuts, swellings or heat etc) this went on
    for a couple of weeks so got the vet out, she
    was taken in for X-rays and all sorts of
    injections in her legs and anything the vet
    could think of (she was at the vets for
    roughly 2week) eventually the vet just said
    they had no idea why she was lame and that
    its perminant. After 5months of lameness she
    was sound again and fine to be ridden. I
    continued to ride her fine mainly hacking
    with some schooling or jumping for about 2
    years. Since then i've put her on loan a few
    times and shes gone lame from what i can
    gather this is why - 1st time on loan the
    loaner trotted her on roads for over an hour
    and she was then lame for 2months - 2nd tome
    on loan larger rider and constantly ridden in
    school bending on hardish ground and was lame
    for 4 months - 3rd time small rider ridden
    ridden only in school again and was lame for
    2/3months. Each time its the same leg shes
    lame on, i find that running cold water on it
    helps but as i said theres no heat or
    swelling. I was wondering if you have any
    idea as to what it could be or how i may be
    able to prevent it so she can be used more,
    at the moment shes hacked lightly and doing
    fine though. Shes only ever had a problem
    with being lame since the day she escaped 4
    years ago, before that i use to compete every
    weekend jumping showing xcountrys etc for 4
    years with no problem, shes 14.2hh and 14 now
    i got her when she was 5 she came from
    american adventure originaly sold on at
    4years to who i brought her off who broke her
    lightly and i brought her on from there with
    no problems. I know shes 3/4 quarter horse
    not 100% what the other 1/4 is. Sorry to
    ramble wanted to get everthing out. I
    understand not many replies are now given but
    any advice will be listened to and i will be
    greatfull although i also understand i may
    never get to the bottom of her lameness.
    Thanks for reading.<br>
    Regards, Gemma.<br>
    P.s i've uploaded a picture of her to show
    her weight and leg build. Shes the bay.<br>

    ANSWER: There are two types of horses:
      Those that are hurt and those
    that will be hurt.<br>
    <br>
    My first thought is stop giving her to others
    so they can hurt her.   She has a
    injury, jumping, running on hard ground and
    shoes are the worst things for this horse.
      You said when you left her alone
    she got better, no shit, she was not carrying
    an extra 150 lbs, she was not being run, she
    was not being jumped.... I can't imagine why
    she got better....<br>
    <br>
    You asked for my opinion and I almost always
    take the horse's side.   This horse
    can't tell you it hurts, just because you
    can't see pain does not mean she is better.
      I hurt a lot of the time when I
    some things and I don't limp or you would not
    know it.   Just because she is not
    limping does not mean she is not hurting.
      Go do some jumping jack on the
    cement and I bet your feet, ankles or knees
    will hurt and you may not limp.<br>
    <br>
    I say stop jumping her absolutely.
      That is the worst thing for a
    healthy horse, it causing pounding,
    concussions, pressure and puts all 1000
    pounds on two small hooves with compounding
    force.   Think about it a horse
    walks on four hooves to support their weight,
    you cut that support in half when you jump
    since the horse lands on two front feet.. if
    you don't think that is a big deal, go stand
    on a chair and you jump to the ground with
    only ONE foot for support, cut you support in
    half and maybe you will see how much pain it
    causes, once again, people forget or don't
    want to think like a horse.<br>
    <br>
    How often do you see horses running in the
    wild, not often.   How often do you
    see them jumping, very rarely if ever.
      So we do these things 100 times
    more often and we add a saddle and the weight
    of a rider, run horses in circles and then
    wonder why so many horses have leg
    problems...   it is pretty clear to
    me.   You did not say and I hope
    you are not doing it, but a lot of people
    deal with this by giving bute to "ease" the
    pain.. this is abuse in my book, you ride and
    work a horse in pain, so you give them drugs
    to hide the pain so the horse won't limp and
    then later the horse has 5 times the pain and
    just stands around hurting...<br>
    <br>
    So if you stop what you do, the will stop
    re-inuring this leg.   <br>
    <br>
    What I say next is not the problem or will
    not fix the problem, and pictures can be
    deceiving, but the hoof looks trimmed too low
    in heel or too long in toe, which might be
    causing some discomfort and the front right
    hoof looks too long in the heel, almost
    club... but again some time pictures to not
    show what is really there, just something to
    look at.... not so you can give the horse to
    someone to jump or run her, I say this to
    maybe ease some of the discomfort for the
    horse.<br>

    <p>Question: I am working with a 14 yr old
    half arab mare that has apparently an issue
    with refusal and flipping over. I say
    apparently, as she has not flipped on me YET,
    but I have known her since she was foaled,
    and am familiar with her training history. I
    have worked with her for 2 weeks now, and in
    that time she has been coming along
    beautifully. I rode her the second day, walk,
    trot, and canter, very green, but did
    everything I asked, although without a
    headset. Twenty minutes on the third day and
    she stands while   mounting, and
    doesn't walk through the bit. I work her in a
    full cheek snaffle in the round pen, with a
    martingale, and she settles in to the lesson
    nicely. The other day while riding her in the
    arena, she heard the voice of her former
    trainer and almost immediately refused going
    forward and got very light in front. I got
    off, remounted and quit her for the day. The
    next day, after our regular round pen lesson,
    I mounted in the arena, walked her
    uneventfully for about five minutes when she
    again refused and got light in front.<br>
    I am attracted to her intelligence and
    sensitivity to the point that I want to give
    her a chance, but this is the one area I am
    afraid of. I know the hands that broke her
    were inexperienced and very heavy. Under a
    trainers advice, she was pulled over in long
    lines when she reared. Since then she has
    flipped numerous times in the long lines and
    under saddle, and I understand her reluctancy
    to trust anyone aboard.<br>
    Please, if there are any methods that DON'T
    involve popping her on the pole, tying her
    head between her knees, or any other
    man-handling ridiculousness, I would love to
    hear them. I need to break INTO her mind,
    without breaking both our bodies!<br>
    Thank you</p>

    <p><br>
    Answer: Most flipping over, like most issues,
    are caused by people that don't know what
    they are doing.   I have seen so
    called clinicians flip horses during demos
    and then blame the horse.<br>
    <br>
    I have never seen a horse flip over if only
    one rein is pulled and the horse is able to
    find release.   When a horse flips
    they are normally pulled over by a scared
    rider that pulled on both reins, leaned back
    and pulled the horse over, or a stupid tie
    down or things are used to hold the horse's
    head down and then the horse cannot find
    release so it panics and flips.   A
    "trainer" at UC Davis killed a horse by doing
    this stupid stunt.<br>
    <br>
    I would push this horse hard on the ground,
    make it speed up slow down stop and turn lots
    and with energy.   Really make sure
    this horse knows what go means, what stop
    means, what turn means and try and push this
    horse stress level up so it will get scared
    and nervous and confused, then give good
    direction and help the horse deal with this.
      That way when you are on the back
    you will know what the horse knows and how to
    get it to do what you want and if the horse
    gets stuck, you can help it move out.
      When a horse stalls, you have to
    put it to work and not let sit there and
    build up a blow up.   So back up,
    flex, turn, move out, something that the
    horse knows well.   Ride time will
    fix this.   Getting off the horse
    when nervous will only teach the horse how to
    get you off.   If the horse rears
    always only pull ONE rein and lean forward,
    if you get off balance and fall backwards
    then you end up pulling the horse on top of
    you or making the fall back on top of
    you.</p>

    <p>Question: Hi, I have a bucking question
    that is a bit different than those I found on
    your website.   I have a ten year
    old gelding who hasn't been ridden a lot.
      He was trained as a three year
    old by a professional natural horsemanship
    trainer, who had a hard time getting him to
    relax - he was very tense when ridden and
    felt like a 'powder keg'.   Over
    the years, he has become relaxed and willing.
      The problem is if something
    spooks him, he doesn't shy, but just explodes
    into bucking with no warning.
      Last time this happened because a
    dog who was on the ride jumped out of the
    bushes right beside him.   I was on
    the ground before I even realized he was
    going to buck.   He isn't generally
    spooky, but I feel really unsafe riding him
    because of the lack of warning signs and the
    power behind his bucking when it does happen
    (he's dumped me twice in four years, but I am
    experienced and generally would be able to
    get control before the buck happens).
      Any suggestions?<br>
    Thanks for your help (I'm getting too old to
    be hitting the ground)</p>

    <p>Answer: This sounds like a different one.
    As he gets older it should get less, but you
    said he is not ridden much, so that is my
    clue, "ride time" will help, I would do lot
    of sacking out while he is saddled and try
    and get him to buck and when he does do not
    stop sacking out, keep pressure until he
    stops bucking.   So tie him good,
    saddle up, sack out and try and get bucks,
    the more he bucks and you do not stop
    pressure, the more he will learn that bucking
    gets him nothing but tired, a lot of work and
    does not get release from pressure.
      So far, his bucks have gotten him
    release since you end up on ground.
      He has to be taught that dealing
    with fear with bucking is not good so he can
    learn that he can be scared and not have to
    buck.   <br>
    <br>
    If you can find a young guy who thinks
    bucking is fun, have him ride the horse in a
    round pen and you go spook or sack out and
    see if the horse bucks and let the young guy
    ride it out, and that will help the horse
    learn bucking gets him nothing, it will also
    allow the rider to correct the bucking by
    taking the head away and stopping the horse
    from bucking so the horse learns not to
    buck.<br>
    <br>
    Time is the key, if you don't have to ride
    the horse enough, then you will not have time
    to work with the horse enough, and the horse
    will not get better.</p>

    very smooth, but is getting where he starts
    stepping away when i start to get if the

    horse is telling you, he does not respect
    you, he does not trust you, he does not think
    you are a good leader, you are not giving him
    enough direction, he is doing this since you
    have not stopped him and he is testing you
    and you are failing the test.<br>

    Read my horsemanship page on my site about
    test, rearing, herd behavior and pecking
    order, it will help make this clearer.<br>

    <p>Question: Hi, I have had my filly, "Shilo"
    for about two months now. She is 15 months
    old, and honestly has come a long way
    considering she was never weaned or even
    haltered before I picked her up.<br>
    I have now gotten her into some good habits
    with leading, haltering, allowing me to catch
    her etc, but now I am having issues with her
    biting me.<br>
    When I went to go look at her during
    purchasing, she did grab my shirt and bit my
    boot while I was paying attention to another
    horse. I thought maybe this was for
    attention. Now I have been bitten in the
    butt, pretty badly while bathing her, and she
    is sneaky about it. I shmucked her in the
    butt as soon as she did it, and she hasn't
    bitten badly since, but she will try and I
    catch her slowly lifting her lip to grab me.
    She will do it if you are not watching, and
    now sometimes slyly looking face to face. I
    don't understand why?<br>
    I try to listen to her, and it's not an
    aggressive bite (anymore) as the last bite
    was a scrape of the teeth on my shoulder, but
    bad manners nonetheless.<br>
    I need to know why she is doing this and how
    to correct it, as it seems not to be a test
    of authority. She backs up when she is told,
    she eases up out of my space when told, I
    have her trotting on command, and she will
    stay out of my territory on command while we
    are beginning to learn to lunge. She's saucy,
    she is and sometimes needs re-direction or
    correction but never more than a nudge, push,
    hard word, or a tap of the leg to pick
    up.<br>
    I just don't get it, it's as though she just
    can't help herself to put her teeth on your
    skin. If I say EH! loudly she stops, but
    thats when I catch her. I want her to
    stop!<br>
    I can't imagine people would taste good
    :)</p>

    <p>Answer:I did an article on Nip, bite or
    nuzzle, you can read it on my Articles page
    of my web site.   This does not
    sound right the way you explain it.
      You see this through your filters
    so I may see this different than you.
      If this horse bites you, you need
    to smack it hard in the mouth not tap it on
    the butt.   I let my horses nuzzle
    me and lip me, but they know if teeth touch
    me, the get smacked.   If this
    horse bites you hard, it is disrespect or a
    test and either is unacceptable.
      You have allowed this, you have
    not corrected it hard enough, so the horse
    thinks it is ok.   With that said,
    all young horses are mouthy and they explore
    with their lips, I do not like to discourage
    this, so you have to weigh this and decide
    how to deal with it.<br>
    <br>

    <hr>

    <p>Question: I read a one of your recent
    responses to someones query about dealing
    with their horse which spooked on the road
    and you advsied not to make the horse stand
    still but to help it know that you understood
    its fear but you didn't really give any
    advice on how you do that......what should I
    do if my horse spooks at something in the
    hedge when I am riding and turns its bottom
    out into the middle of the road or refuses to
    go forward past the object. Generally I stop
    and pat her and then push her on but what do
    you advise, what is teh correct way to deal
    with it to give the horse confidence yet stay
    safe to avoid any clashes with traffic?</p>

    <p>Answer: I often give advice that seems
    many don't understand since I "think like a
    horse".   If you read my website
    and study the horse you would understand my
    answers better.   My web site has
    over 400 pages of Free information.
      Yet most people want me to write
    that much on each of their questions.
      Your horse's safety and your
    safety depends on YOU, not the horse.
      The horse is doing what you tell
    her and being where you make her be.
      Your horse is telling you she is
    nervous, scared, that she does not trust you
    enough to ignore or control her fear, she is
    telling you that you have not prepared her
    right, that you have demonstrated that you
    are a good leader she should follow and
    listen too.   You are not hearing
    this since you don't understand her, much
    like you will not get this answer since you
    don't understand where I am coming from.
      <br>
    <br>
    Stopping and petting her may be ok, it could
    be right if it works, but the horse is saying
    it does not work so you need to change what
    you do.   You want me to tell you
    what to change, I can't do that since
    depending on the horse does, each time you
    change what you do, will depend on what you
    do next, you have know, you have to adjust,
    you have to understand, so I could tell you
    anything and it may or may not work, but if
    you really understand horses, you would know
    what to do, how to adjust, how to set the
    horse up for success and to take the time it
    takes so it will take less time.
      <br>
    <br>
    Taking a horse to traffic and trying to stay
    safe is not very smart or safe. You don't
    know the danger you are putting your horse
    and you in and as always, the horse will pay
    for your mistakes.   A horse does
    not know a car will kill him, but he will run
    blindly to avoid it if you put him in a
    situation too fast where you cause his fear
    to turn into survival flight.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site, invest time in your horse and
    yourself by reading it, it will help you more
    you will know.   Then if you have
    questions about what you read, let me
    know.</p>

    <p>Question: Good afternoon, I recently
    bought a freisian yongest 2.5 year old colt.
    I had this horse vetted before I made the
    purchase but sadly it wasn't disclosed that
    this horse wind sucked.   I only
    discovered this nasty habit a few days later.
    He has come to a loving home where he roams
    freely on our small holding and has access to
    lots of good hay and lovely feed.
      <br>
    <br>
    We have tried to establish a pattern of when
    the wind sucking occurs and it seems to be
    after he has eaten, almost like a smoker who
    likes to light up after a meal.<br>
    <br>
    The advice we have had has been very divided
    and the collar route for us doesn't seem to
    be an option.<br>
    <br>
    Any further help would be much appreciated,
    apart from this nasty vice he is a
    beautifully chilled relaxed horse.<br>
    Many thanks</p>

    <p>Answer:Other horses and free roaming will
    stop this, most horses do this from habit and
    from being locked up and bored to death.
      They make a cribbing paint or you
    can wrap hot wire or hot tape (electric
    shock)around everything he cribs on, so every
    time he tries he gets shocked.   It
    sounds mean, but this habit is not only
    annoying it is bad for his health.
      It can cause colic and other
    issues.   Turn this horse out in a
    herd and it will go away.   This is
    a cruel habit created by cruel people who
    want to lock a horse up in stall, and keep a
    horse as a pet like a caged dog so they can
    visit the horse an hour a day.
      Now the horse has to live with it
    for life while the jerks who caused it get to
    move on.   If you keep this horse
    locked up in a stall, I don't think you can
    stop it, a horse is a herd animal that needs
    other horses, they only sleep maybe 2 hours a
    day that means they have 22 hours to be
    caged, not a good life and that is why all
    these horrible stall vices occur such as
    pacing, swaying, cribbing, wind sucking,
    stomping, kicking walls, being aggressive and
    protective of their stall.....all caused by
    humans that claim to love their horse.<br>
    <br>
    The reason you compare this to a smoker is
    the wind sucking is said to cause a release
    of endorphins that give the horse a high, and
    in fact it is an addiction to these
    endorphins, which is why once it starts it is
    hard, if not impossible to break.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Question: I recently bought 3 horses from
    a family who couldn't afford to keep them,
    the horses were all but neglected. Anyways,
    two of the three are great horses, awesome
    personalities, gentle et... but the 9 yr. old
    is extremely skittish, its a chore to catch
    him, and often scary to do so, but once
    caught he seems to do ok...until you tie him,
    he leads great and is very gentle, however
    once tied he freaks! Almost ripping the
    hitchin post out of the ground, he will stand
    untied and be saddled, but dont try to tie
    him! He will be used for Trail riding and
    hunting, How do I break him of this as he
    will need to be tied in the mountains. Also
    he freaks when coming near the trailer, he
    acts as though he was beat with a lead or
    tied up for extremely long periods of time?
    In both situations he takes it to the point
    of almost hurting himself, He has tons of
    potential if we can get past this, anything
    you have that could help would be greatly
    appreciated. Thank you.</p>

    <p>Answer: All horses will tie and all will
    not tie......the difference is who is tying
    them.. I have a page on my web site Tying a
    horse, make sure and use a good rope halter
    and NO snaps on lead rope.   If you
    have a big tree, tie him to it and let him
    pull away.   He will get tired and
    figure out that pulling only gets him tired
    and gets his neck sore, he will stop pulling.
      Just don't let him get free once
    you tie him or he will learn to fight, which
    is probable what has happened or when he
    freaked out someone untied him so he learned
    that freaking out gets him untied.<br>
    <br>
    You may be right about beating at the
    trailer, but you have to start over, I also
    have a page on trailer loading on my
    site.<br>
    <br>
    Since you are asking these questions, I think
    you will find lots of info on my site, try
    reading it often, it is pretty big what if
    you read it all, you will know more about
    horses than most people.</p>

    <p>Question:QUESTION: Our 4-H and sheriffs
    dept rescued several neglected horses of
    which one was about a 2-3 month old filly
    (nearly dead) and the mare had to be put down
    because she was to far gone.
      Anyway, about 2 weeks of 4-H
    nursing her back, we adopted her.
        She is coming along
    so wonderfully.     She
    took to a halter right away without any
    hesitation,   she walks and leads
    and of course now and then puts up a little
    fuss while walking but it is only for a
    second or two. When walking, on a bad day she
    will try to walk against us but we are
    working on that.   We also starting
    picking up her feet in the beginning and a
    week ago started picking them.   No
    fuss with that either.   Every day
    gets better with her.
        I don't know if I am
    trying to teach her to much at one time.
            What
    are your thoughts on this.
        Thank You in
    Advance.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: No, I think you are fine, young
    horses are like sponges, they take in a lot.
      You cannot teach this horse how
    to be a horse, only another horse can do
    that, so let it be with horses as much as
    possible.   Horses that are raised
    by people and no other horses, make really
    bad horses and end up hurting people and
    themselves.   So make sure she has
    a horse buddy, is turned out with other
    horses and spends more time with horses than
    people.<br>
    ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------<br>
    <br>
    QUESTION: Thank you so much for your answer.
    I just wanted you to know that today we tied
    her up for about 15 mins. and just sat there
    and watched her just in case of a problem.
        She did so well.
      Didnt put up a fuss either.
        What is your feeling
    about tying this young and for what duration
    of time.   Also you stated she
    should have a horse buddy, I also have a 25
    yr old mare and my mare's 6 yr old gelding.
        My filly is actually
    in the pen next to my mare and every morning
    we turn the three of them out for about 20
    mins. while we clean their pens.
        Is it okay that I
    have her in a separate pen next to my mare or
    should I open up her pen to my mare's for
    closer contact.
          Thanks in
    advance.</p>

    <p>Answer: I would put them together if you
    can, close contact is not the same as a herd,
    by keeping them apart she cannot make
    mistakes and the older horse cannot teach or
    correct her..   Horses only sleep
    about 2 hours per day, that leaves 22 hours
    to get bored, that time needs to be spent
    with other horses teaching, grazing,
    socializing, playing and growing and moving.
      Just make sure you are tying her
    with a good rope halter so she can't break
    any buckles or snaps, she is going to get
    bored or scared and try and pull away, she
    has to learn that pulling does not get her
    free, if she gets free, she will pull more
    and more, so make sure when you tie her, she
    cannot get away.   Trying is good,
    do things to her while tied.
      Groom her, give her grain, pick
    her feet, sit and read a book with her, even
    have her move so she will have to give to
    pressure and know she is tied.</p>

    <p>Question:I grew up on a horse farm, albeit
    many years ago, in KY. I am now in Oklahoma
    and have been for the past 30 years. My
    neighbors have a small tract of land, and a 3
    horses. There really isn't enough room for
    these horses, but in general, they seem to be
    tended to, exercised and they have an overall
    good appearance. My concern is, that I just
    noticed a lady chasing one of the horses with
    a canvas looking cloth. Later that evening
    while driving by, I notice the horse was
    wearing this canvas type cloth over his
    eyes.<br>
    I understand how blinders work, to keep the
    horse from being distracted by side views,
    but I have never seen a horse completely
    blinded. The horse is walking around and
    eating today, but still with the blinder on.
    It has been a day and a half now, and though,
    I don't know the people, I have never
    suspected neglect or abuse, but I am very
    curious as to what purpose the blindfold
    serves.<br>
    I don't remember ever seeing this in KY,
    however, it has been alot of years ago.
    Perhaps I missed something.<br>
    I have searched for the answer to this
    question, but they all go back to the
    winker/blinkers. Again, I know the purpose of
    those, but this is different.<br>
    If you could put my mind to rest about this,
    I won't worry about the horse and mind my own
    business.<br>
    Thanks for any information you can give.</p>

    <p>Answer: Are you sure it is not a fly mask.
    If it is a burlap bag, these people may not
    be able to afford a fly mask and they are
    using the bad to keep flies out of the eyes
    or an open cut.   There is an old
    cowboy thing of blindfolding a horse to
    train.   Not a great concept but it
    can be used to teach a horse some things.
      Not good if they are just letting
    it run lose.<br>
    <br>
    It sounds like you care about these horses,
    so I would suggest you go introduce yourself,
    say you like horses and have not been around
    them in many years, and ask if it would be OK
    for you to bring them an apple or carrots
    once in a while.   Then you get a
    closer look, maybe you will see that they are
    hurting for money and then you could buy a
    bail of hay or a bag of oats and help these
    horses out.   Maybe they don't
    know, maybe they are not taking care of them
    and this way you can get a closer look and
    then report them if need be.
      <br>
    <br>
    I would do it for the horses and who knows it
    may work out good for everyone, especially
    the horses.....   :)</p>

    <p>QUESTION: I have a quarter horse that only
    pulls back when I try to saddle him. I can
    high line him and I can tie him up once the
    saddle is on.   He only does this
    when trying to saddle him.   What
    can I do.   He has broken a few
    lead ropes.   I have to back him up
    to a fence or have someone hold him to saddle
    him.   He has to be held to do so.
      It is difficult for me to throw
    the saddle up with one hand and hold with the
    other if I am saddling him by my self. Any
    help would be appreciated.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: This is a you issue not a horse
    issue. I always take the horse's side since
    it is never the horse's fault.
      You say he broke a lead rope, I
    say you did not have him tied right with a
    good lead rope and halter, so you set the
    horse up to fail by doing this and he pulled
    and got away, so you taught the horse that
    you cannot tie him, so now he will pull more,
    had he not got away, he would not pull now,
    but you taught him to pull and get release by
    pulling since you used a cheap or incorrect
    lead rope.   So now you want to
    think this is a horse issue, this is a you
    issue.   This horse pulls and moves
    and tries to prevent you saddling him since
    he knows he is smarter than you, he knows you
    are not smart enough to stop him, he gets
    away with it so he thinks it is the right
    answer, you let him get away with it and
    teach him it is the right answer.<br>
    <br>
    A does what it does because we do what we do.
    If you change the horse will change.<br>
    <br>
    I could spend 10 mins with this horse and he
    would stand still, let me saddle him and he
    would do it without being tied.... why,
    because I would show him I am the high horse,
    he has to listen to me and I am the lead
    horse.   I could get a horse to
    understand this in 10 mins, it would take me
    years to teach you.   Only you can
    learn to think like a horse.<br>
    <br>
    If you read my web site, it will help you
    understand horse better and then this problem
    will go away.   You are looking at
    this problem and I see this is only a symptom
    of you not understanding horses.</p>

    <p>QUESTION: hi. i watched a video of yours
    on how to teach a horse to back up under
    saddle. well your training worked but my
    horse backs up really really slow. its not
    even as fast as her regular walk. is this
    normal will she improve i have only been
    doing it like for two weeks or do i need to
    watch your video one more time to make sure i
    am doing it right.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: My video was very short and just was
    an example. You have to make sure your horse
    knows a cue to speed up, if you go slow and
    help the horse understand you get she will
    get faster, not sure why you need her to go
    faster.   But you may want to teach
    her on the ground and have her back up faster
    when you click and say back and put more
    pressure so she learns how to back faster.
      <br>
    <br>
    I would not get too caught up on a fast back
    up, if you do it right, over time your horse
    will get better and the faster will come
    naturally.   <br>

    QUESTION: thank you thats what i wanted to no
    she dont even back up as fast as the horse in
    your video.she takes one step at a time like
    5 secs apart.   so i thought i was
    doing something wrong. i appreciate your
    advice and time   it is
    helpful.</p>

    <p>Answer: Your welcome, remember horses in
    the wild do not back up very much, it is not
    safe and they can't see where they are going
    or where they are putting their feet.
      So the back up is a human thing
    and it will take time for them to get used to
    it.<br>
    <br>
    She will get, try and have her do it more
    when you are on the ground when she wants to
    get somewhere.   Like if she really
    wants to get to her food, have her back up a
    few steps to get to the food, if she wants to
    get to pasture, have her back up the last few
    steps to the gate, that way she will want to
    speed up and it will be her idea, horses
    learn better that way.</p>

    <p>Question: Bought an 11 year old Arabian
    gelding couple years ago. Rode well at first,
    then decided no one would mount him anymore.
      Worked him in round pen for quite
    awhile.   He has great ground
    manners but still, lets you saddle him, but
    throws you off immediately upon trying to
    mount.   Vet has checked him out
    and seems ok.   Anything I can do
    short of getting in an expert who doesn't
    mind getting busted up?
      Thanks.</p>

    <p>Answer: Your question tells me that since
    you had the horse for two years and I would
    guess you would not buy a horse that did
    this, it seems to me that you taught the
    horse to do the things it is doing. A horse
    is only a reflection of who is handling it.
      You taught this for two years and
    you are looking for a fix over an email,
    won't happen.   A horse will only
    do what it is allowed to do.   You
    said something about an expert (not a big fan
    of that word), but if you get someone that
    understand horses, a horseman, they will not
    get busted up. Since they know horse they
    will understand this horse has not had good
    direction and is doing what it does because
    of what is being done to him.
      <br>
    <br>
    The horse is the only expert of knowing
    horses, since you think this is a horse
    problem, you do not understand horses and I
    always tell people, it is never the horses
    fault.   This horse is telling you,
    you don't understand horses, he is telling
    you that you are not a good leader, he is
    telling you that he does not trust or respect
    you, but you can hear this or understand it
    since you don't speak horse.
      <br>
    <br>
    Read my website from start to finish and you
    will see horses differently and maybe realize
    that you caused everything this horse is
    doing and only you can fix it.</p>

    <p>Q: Brief history of the equine in
    question: 16.1, 12 y/o, TB, 3rd level
    Dressage, and was a successful show jumper-
    breeding stallion. Was shown over 5' jumps,
    but his career ended because of lack of care.
    His sale price was $36K but no one would buy
    him. He refused jumps and had a few accidents
    during training that hurt his legs. I waited
    for him at the rescue he was sent to. When he
    arrived at the rescue he had only three shoes
    on, his hooves were grossly grown out, his
    heels were underslung, he had wounds on his
    legs, he was lame because he was nearly
    walking on his heel bulbs, one coronet
    injury, a hoof abscess, and bruised soles (he
    has white feet). I brought him home and he
    could hardly walk for three weeks.<br>
    <br>
    Question: After his rescue, he is vet
    checked, massaged, properly shod (but the vet
    said his feet will never be as they were
    prior to neglect), and sound. He is
    performing beautifully as a Dressage horse,
    moving into very advanced and difficult
    movements. I had also wanted to jump with
    him, but he practically has a breakdown when
    he feels he's going to be forced to jump-
    very low jumps, I might add. He doesn't even
    like trotting poles. If he touches a pole on
    the ground it shatters him. When we come to a
    vertical I can feel him become tense under
    me, snorts, over jumps it, then goes into a
    (Thoroughbred) running fit like we're at the
    track. I haven't punished him (I don't hit),
    and when I pull him up during a fit he froths
    at the mouth and quivers. You have more
    expertise than I do, so I won't shove my
    speculations down your throat. I've treated
    the situation like he's had a harsh past.
    He's very familiar with the arena and the
    jumps being there, and the only time he has a
    freak-out is when he knows he's supposed to
    be jumping those obstacles. I saw him perform
    a few years ago as a show jumper with one of
    his former trainers and they placed well in
    the competition- he was in great health at
    that time.<br>
    I spend 5 days a week with him, 8 hours per
    day, I know him very well, he knows my aids,
    and we're very close. While I school him in
    Dressage we're in harmony and he tries very
    hard to understand what I want when I want
    him to do it. So, my point is, asking
    professionals their opinion on the matter is
    a last ditch effort concerning jumping. I am
    perfectly fine with retiring him from jumping
    and showing him in Dressage, I just need to
    know if I am completely missing the point
    somewhere?<br>
    <br>
    I'm not impatient, I just want to make sure
    I'm not making the situation worse. For that
    reason, I haven't jumped him recently. It's
    not his fault. I love him, I have ever since
    I first saw him, and I want to make the best
    decisions possible in his interest.</p>

    <p>Answer: I have to think you have not read
    my website or read any of my other answers. I
    am about the horse. I despise jumping horses.
    It tears down their legs, joints, muscles, it
    is un-natural, painful and destroys horses.
    Asking me if I think you should jump a horse
    is like me asking you should you slam a car
    door on your hand, the answer is very
    obvious. Many many people say they love their
    horse and then do things that I see as
    abusive and mean. Love is relative just
    because someone says it, does not make it so.
    If you were a horse, if you lived as a horse,
    if you understood a horse and was connected
    to a horse, you would not like jumping.
      This is a human, ego,
    competitive, win sport at the total expense
    and pain of the horse.   Since most
    jumpers that 'love' their horses don't
    understand what it does to a horse, they
    justify it or rationalize it and as always,
    the horse pays for it.<br>
    <br>
    Think about it, a 1200 pound animal that
    normally walks or four small hooves and thin
    legs suddenly gets dropped on only two hooves
    and legs, then you put steel plants on the
    feet for the horse to land on which only
    compounds the impact and pressure and damage,
    then you add a 150-200 pound rider, then you
    add speed and then you do it over and over to
    look good and all the while your horses is in
    pain and paying a severe cost. Do this
    exercise then tell me jumping does not hurt a
    horse. Get on a chair in your house and jump
    off, not straight down, jump up off the chair
    and land on two feet. Then do again and hold
    one foot up (cutting your support in half,
    just like you do to the horse)and land on
    only one foot, then after you do that, move
    the chair on concrete and land on one foot
    (like landing on steel shoes), then, run to
    the chair and do it again landing on one
    foot, then after you tell me it is not that
    bad, put a 40 pound weight in a back pack,
    strap it to your back and do it again. Then
    do it every day, ten or 20 times a day for a
    week, then if you can walk after the first
    day, tell me how great and beautiful it is to
    make a horse do it.<br>
    <br>
    This horse has been abused, hurt, neglected
    and had a sh**y life thanks to people who
    loved him. MY OPINION, is if you love this
    horse, you would get rid of his shoes, good
    barefoot trims, nice friendly rides NOT in an
    arena, allow him to enjoy spending time with
    you, not working, not trying to fit into some
    category or rules and just take rides in
    fields where he can graze, walk and enjoy
    being with a human that is not constantly
    requiring something from him. And when you
    are not grooming him or being his herd buddy,
    you keep him out of a stall and in the
    biggest open area you can and you let him
    hang out and be and play with other horses
    when not with you.   I say this
    since if I was a horse, that is where I would
    want to be.<br>

    <p>Question: I have an issue regarding a colt
    born to one of my mares this year. He was
    unexpected. We are not sure how long he was
    out in the field before he was found Easter
    friday.The problem I am having is that he is
    a bit on the wild side and wants nothing to
    do with us. I was hoping you might have some
    advice on the best way to halter train him
    with minimal risk to him or to us.<br>
    Thanks Amanda</p>

    <p>Answer: Well the fact that you could be
    surprised concerns me more than a young horse
    that you cannot get a halter.   All
    horses are on the wild side.   How
    can someone not know a mare is pregnant for
    11 months and then not know the horse
    suddenly lost a lot of weight and then just
    find a baby in the field?   These
    things are not something that should be
    happening to responsible horse owners.
      Didn't this mare get shots, seen
    by a vet, have her feet done, given baths
    when hot, checked for injuries?????
      Explain this a little more so I
    know I am not wasting my time helping
    you.</p>

    <p>Question: I just bought a horse and I do
    not have any other horses, and I am getting
    ready to bring her home soon.   I
    cannot buy a goat because we have dogs in the
    area, coyotes and bobcats that would kill a
    goat.   I do not want to get more
    horses or any other animals for a stablemate.
      Years ago I had a horse that
    lived without any horses or stablemates and
    he was a happy, well adjusted horse.
      How often does this happen, that
    a horse does not need a stablemate?
      What kind of symptoms would a
    horse have that needed a stablemate?
      Thank you.  </p>

    <p>Answer: Horses do not feel safe alone,
    they need other prey animals to keep watch
    and help them relax, sleep and feel safe, to
    share the work load, which is why horses are
    not solitary animals, they Herd animals, not
    pets, not meant to be alone. In my opinion,
    getting a horse knowing you are going to keep
    it alone is selfish and not fair to the
    horse, but many people do it.   I
    don't agree with it.   The damage
    is too large to explain in one email, read my
    horsemanship page and my bad horsemanship
    page and it will explain it.</p>

    <p>Question: G'Day<br>
    i have a rising 4 year old gelding, with a
    great temperament, unfortionally he has grown
    very attached to a mare we already had. i am
    starting to campdraft the horse and he wants
    to go straight back to her on the fence or
    back at the float.<br>
    <br>
    i have managed through persistence to get him
    to go away of late, but yesterday after a
    ride with my daughter, he turned it on, as i
    have had them separated for 7 - 10 hoping
    this will fix the issue.<br>
    <br>
    i have only been riding for about 2 years,
    and have come off him once, i find if i stop
    him back him up and turn the way i want to go
    he normally walks off. the horse is a
    quarter/stock horse. i look forward to your
    reply, advice.<br>
    <br>
    regards<br>
    <br>
    Answer: Your horse is being normal, no big
    surprise here. He is is still a baby and
    growing until five.   He will be
    insecure and nervous when away from the horse
    that keeps him safe and he spends most time
    with.   If you visited me and I
    took you to downtown Oakland, CA and then
    left you, you would feel lost and insecure
    too.<br>
    <br>
    Understand horses better will help you to
    help this horse. When training a young new
    horse, you should have a good second horse
    with you, so the horse can learn to trust you
    while stilling the comfort of another horse
    with him. I would let his friend tag along on
    the rides, she will follow and they both get
    exercise or have someone ride her and you
    just follow her with the young horse. This is
    all about teaching the horse nice and slow
    and not pushing or forcing him to his fear.
      If you fight this and try and
    force this with the horse by himself you will
    only create more and bigger problems.<br>
    <br>
    Work this from the horse's point of view not
    yours. Stop thinking like a human who wants
    to train a horse and think like a horse that
    is young, scared, insecure and trying to stay
    alive.   <br>
    <br>
    Read my website and do some sacking out, I
    discuss this on my horsemanship page.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Question: I read your website but have a
    question. My horse use to be in a hurry to
    get back to the barn so we went riding a lot
    coming and going and now its not a problem
    when we ride alone.   Yesterday I
    went riding with friends and the horses were
    walking faster than us on the way back. I
    need your help because I don't want my horse
    to get back into bad habits so what can I do
    so I can ride with my frinds and not be in a
    hurry</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Don't ride with bad riders that
    let their horse do bad things. Any horse will
    want to keep up when another horse is acting
    nervous, insecure or in a hurry since horses
    like to stay alive and their herd instincts
    take over, when they see another horse
    (apparently) reacting to a possible threat.
      A smart horse will not want to be
    in the back of another horse running from
    something that might eat him.
      <br>
    <br>
    Your horse should listen to you, but you will
    fighting lots of survival instincts and I
    would rather not fight with my horse if I can
    prevent it.   With that said, I
    don't let my horse dictate who I ride or how
    fast they go.   So like most of my
    answers, this if a you issue, you need to get
    better, you need to show this horse it has to
    listen to you, you need to be able to
    communicate with this horse and make him not
    want to be in a hurry.   <br>
    <br>
    You are working against some strong draws
    (see my article on draw) so if you were
    better your horse would be better.
      Your horse is telling you that it
    will listen to you when another horse is not
    telling him to be nervous.   Since
    you can't control other riders or other
    horses, this is a tricky one and you have to
    decide what you gain and what you lose by
    doing what you do?</p>

    <p>Question: My neighbors bought a few horses
    this month, a first they both seemed health
    after a week or two both horses have started
    having coughing spells. The horses didn't
    come from the same place so I'm confused at
    to why they both have a cough. These symptoms
    didn't start until after a few rainy days.
    Both have been on trail rides since being
    here but neither coughed while working. I
    have had horses all my life and they came to
    me for help. I told them that it may have
    been from the hay they have been getting.
    However the hay isn't very dusty, just mildly
    like all hay is. Can you help me?</p>

    <p>Answer: They could just have a cold type
    virus, one may have had it and gave it to the
    other one.   If they do not have a
    temp, if they are still eating and real
    lethargic, let it work out over a couple of
    weeks. If it gets worse, they have blood from
    nose, stop eating and drinking, then call a
    vet. If they get abscesses on the neck or
    throat area, it may be strangles, but they
    will have a high fever, call a vet.<br>
    <br>
    I would make sure they had free access to hay
    so they can eat all the want when they want,
    maybe some extra carrots and apples, and I
    like to give my boys some oats and rice bran
    when they are fighting something, just some
    extra energy food to keep their system up and
    working.<br>
    <br>
    I would not work them hard, but some exercise
    is good.</p>

    <p>Q: My 5 year old Rocky Mountain mare has
    kicked at other horses 3 times this summer.
    She has only done this when moving faster
    than a walk. It appears that she is
    competitive and does not like to be passed.
    This dangerous behavior is totally
    unacceptable.<br>
    What is the best method to extinguish this
    behavior?<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Like most horse problems this is a
    people issue. You want to see this as your
    horse is kicking other horses, I see this as
    you are not paying attention, you are not
    controlling him, you have not taught him that
    he should not and can not do that, you are
    allowing other horses to get too close, you
    are not keeping your horse far enough away to
    prevent or stop him, you are not giving good
    enough direction to the horse so it knows not
    to do this, you are not being a strong enough
    leader so the horse is ignoring you.
      So it all depends on how you look
    at it.   From your view it is the
    horse, from my way it is you.   If
    you can't control this horse so it does not
    do this, it is only a matter of time until
    the horse does other things you don't want,
    since it does not respect you as
    leader.<br>
    <br>
    You did not say this in your question and did
    not give me much info on your experience or
    how long you have had the horse.
      My guess is that the horse
    started this behavior with you or after you
    had it for a while, since I am pretty sure
    you would not buy a horse that you knew would
    be kicking other horses.   If that
    is true then that makes the point that you
    caused this by not paying attention, not
    knowing this was going to happen and not
    stopping it, preventing it or making sure the
    horse knows that it is unacceptable.<br>
    <br>
    Again my guess is this is not the only thing
    this horse does that you do not want it do.
    You ask for the best method, the best method
    for all horse problems is to look to
    yourself, see what you are doing to cause it,
    what you are not doing to prevent it and
    where the lack of communication and
    understand break down is.   There
    are lots of way to stop this, first being pay
    attention, if I put my horses head in another
    horse's butt or face he can't kick a horse he
    is facing, if I hit my horse on the butt
    anytime his butt goes towards another horse,
    he will learn that putting his butt at
    another horse gets him a stinging butt, if I
    make my horse face a horse every time he
    thinks about kicking, he will get tired of
    that, if I make my horse run away and stop
    and back up and run back to a horse every
    time he tries to kick, he will soon connect
    that to kicking and he will not want to kick
    since he does not want to work hard when he
    tries.   If you notice a common
    trend here, everything I have said is
    dependent on YOU and what you do. Which is
    why it is never the horses fault.<br>
    <br>
    ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------<br>
    <br>
    QUESTION: I realize the answer is me, that is
    why I asked the question, "what is the best
    method". I wanted to know what I could do,
    and did not feel I was blaming my
    horse.<br>
    I have had horses for 20+ years and this is
    the first horse I have ever had this problem
    with. I bought her as a yearling and have
    been riding her for slightly over one year on
    the trail. She is ridden at least twice a
    week and to date she has well over 1000 miles
    on the trail.<br>
    You are right, this is not the only thing she
    has done. As I resolve one issue she moves on
    to the next. One example is, stopping on the
    trail when she is not confident to rub her
    head on her leg. This was resolved by
    catching her before she dropped her
    head.<br>
    When running she kicks out very quickly, I
    was paying attention and still was not able
    to catch her fast enough. The horses she
    kicked at were far enough away to barely be
    reached, however I can only ride my own horse
    and have no control over the other
    horses.<br>
    I have been doing the things you have
    suggested, and wanted your opinion on the
    BEST method. I thought perhaps you had some
    insight that I did not. Thank you for telling
    me what I already knew, in a not very nice
    way.</p>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>Answer: Silly me, I always get questions
    from people that know so much and they always
    only tell me AFTER I ANSWER THE QUESTIONS how
    much they know.<br>
    <br>
    If you think that was not nice maybe when
    your horse throws you, you can say he was not
    nice either.   You are the only
    owner of this horse, anything bad this horse
    does is a result of you. Since I can't fix
    you and you know so much, keep your questions
    to yourself or ask someone else. Your horses
    would say these things to you if it could
    talk, but I am sure you would tell him how
    much you know and would ignore anything he
    said.   Which is why you are having
    these problems. So thanks for making my
    point. You = only owner = all problems belong
    to you = you telling me how much you
    know.<br>
    <br>
    I have a choice to tell you to take a hike,
    unfortunately your horse cannot. He is stuck
    with you and all your knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    Good day!</p>

          <td valign="top">I always tell people
          not to get caught up too much in a
          horse's past. Not sure what is going on
          or causing this, but, if you just stick
          to basic horse communication, it
          usually works.   A horse does
          not bite, kick or strike a human, no
          time, no where, no how, so I would
          handle this as a disrespect issues and
          push this horse back fast and hard, it
          will stop fast if you address it like
          he just tried to kill you.
            If you don't stop this now
          he will think he is higher and will
          think you are a lower member of his
          herd and will treat you like that.
            Which means he will tell
          you when and where to move and if you
          don't he will correct you like he would
          a horse, with a bite or kick.
            He is NOT being mean he is
          being a horse.   Once a horse
          feels safe he has to try and move up in
          the herd as high as he can.
            There are benefits in being
          higher.   So he has to know,
          he is not higher and he cannot bite or
          kick you or any other person.<br>
          <br>
          As for a disruptive herd member, the
          herd will take care of that, we people
          tend to want to help and save and be
          the protector of our horses and we end
          up making it worse by trying to help.
            Let the herd deal with him,
          you deal with his dealings and behavior
          of you.</td>

    <p>Licking is not bad, my young horse does
    this as well, especially when I am sweaty, he
    likes the salt.   It does not
    matter to me and I let him, he never bits.
      I just did an article on this

    <p>Being so young, she may miss her mom and
    horses that young are very mouthy and use
    their lips as we use our fingers to feel and
    explore.   If you want her to stop,
    you can tap her nose and tell her "Quit",
    that way she will learn the word quit and you
    can use it in later training.<br>
    <br>
    I would let her be a young filly and just
    enjoy the bonding and I think it will make
    your relationship closer for later
    training.</p>

    <p>He is in his terrible twos, you have let
    him know now that his behavior is
    unacceptable.   I would put him in
    pasture with as many horses as you can,
    forget same age, it better to let some old
    mares teach him some manners and push him
    around.   If he is only you and
    people he will soon learn that he can push
    people around and not respect anyone.
      let him get schooled by some
    other horses, he may get a few bites and hoof
    marks, but it will teach him manners like you
    cannot.<br>

    When you say drags you, I say you let him
    drag you, you can either let go and he can
    run away or you can take his head away hard

    pressure.   Don't keep pulling or
    he will pull, yank and release, if you are
    using a piece of junk Web halter, get rid of
    it and get you a good Rope Halter, see my

    a friend's horse because she has not other
    place to board it. Yesterday he pitched a fit
    with her. She was trying to take off his shoe
    because it was lose and the next thing I knew
    he was trying to pull his bridle off his
    head, he succeeded. I think she is too
    aggressive with him and the horse is not
    trained properly. What I would like to know
    is how best to teach this horse to keep his
    hoof up so that "we" can do anything that
    needs to be done, done safely? I have trained
    horses in the past but this is a friends
    horse that has little patience. What can I
    do?<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Tell her she is
    being too rough and not understanding.
      Tell her she is causing the
    problems and let you try.   A horse
    is a reflection of the person handling it.
      You did not say how old she was,
    what her experience is, how old the horse is
    and other helpful information, but it sounds
    like most horse problems, they are not really
    horse problems they are people
    problems.<br>
    <br>
    If someone was able to put shoes on, then the
    horse already knows how to stand and let
    someone handle his feet.   So it
    goes back to the person that shod him knew
    what they were doing and not the owner does
    not.<br>
    <br>
    Your friend is basically training this horse
    to be resistant and now will learn to give
    the farrier a harder time and she is teaching
    bad habits that will end up hurting the horse
    and making the horse pay for her lack of
    knowledge.   She will not listen to
    you, but since you keeping her horse at your
    place you can not allow her to screw up the
    horse and maybe end up causing the horse to
    tear up your place.   Your barn
    your rules.   My barn, horses are
    treated fairly and not abused or neglected or
    you find a new barn.   <br>
    <br>
    Sound like an easy fix for you if you really
    want to stop it, you can.<br>
    <br>
    Rick ( you could just show her my answer and
    make me the bad guy) :)

            <p>If you don't mind it, then he is
            doing what you allow him to do.
              If you want him to stop,
            you have to let him that you do not
            want it.   As for bites
            that is an absolute No NO.
              He should get popped in
            him mouth the second he bites or
            tries to bite.   Biting is
            disrespectful and is telling you that
            you are lower and he is higher.
              You have to tell him no
            and pop him HARD, don't be easy,
            don't be nice, don't ask, tell him so
            there is no confusion and he is clear
            that biting is absolutely
            unacceptable, will not be tolerated
            and will get you hit hard in the
            mouth.   It should only
            take one or two times if you do it
            hard, if you do it easy, then it will
            take 15 or 20 times and the horse
            will be confused.<br>
            <br>
            I let my horses get close to me,
            nuzzle me, rub on me and get in my
            space, I don't have a problem with it
            and know I can stop it if I need to,
            but some people don't like to allow
            it ever, it is a personal choice.
              All you have to do is be
            consistent make sure your horse knows
            what you want and give him clear and
            consistent signals and cues.</p>

  <h3><u><strong>Mules:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>Hi Floyd, my experience with Mules are
    limited. I have heard some interesting things
    about them, the ones I have worked with
    appear to be the same as horses.
      Mules are considered more
    thinking animals.   They will not
    let you abuse them like a horse will.
      Mules tend to be more thinkers
    and evaluators.   They do not
    instinctively run like horses do when in
    fear.   A mules tends to stop,
    freeze, and evaluate.   After they
    size of the situation they then decide to
    fight or flee.   Many people say
    once you ride a mule you will never want a
    horse again.   For those reasons
    they are said to be more of a one owner type
    horse, but if treated right they can be
    handled by different people, if treated wrong
    they will kick your butt and remember.
      Their kicks are said to be much
    more accurate than a horse.<br>
    <br>
    As for like a dog, I think horses are like
    dogs when treated right. No Equine is like a
    dog when it comes to time, care and expenses.
      Horses require much more than a
    dog and I trained dogs for in the military
    for 18 years, so I know dogs pretty well.
      The reason so many new horse
    owners get out of horses (80%) in the first
    year is most people have no clue and when
    they find out how time and effort it takes
    they get out.</p>

    <p>A draft mule would be good, they can go
    1500 pounds or more or a draft horse would
    do.   They say a horse can
    comfortably carry 20 percent of their weight.
      Depending on their level of
    shape, muscle and experience.
      However if you lost some weight
    your balance would improve, your health would
    improve and you could get back in the saddle
    easier.   I know if I dropped 20 or
    30 pounds I would ride better and my horse
    would be happier.   :)</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: You have to stop thinking they are
    just pets.   All horses need to be
    handled so you can doctor them if hurt, trim
    their feet, lead them from danger.
      So you need to understand horses
    (equines) so you will know how to handle them
    and get them to trust you.   I have
    never worked with a donkey, but they are part
    of the equine family so they should respond
    accordingly.   Read my web site,
    especially the herd behavior section and the
    sacking out section.   This will
    help you understand pressure and release.
      These guys know since they let
    the other owner do it, so you need to learn
    or ask the old own to help you out or call a
    farrier who may be willing to work on them
    for extra money or you need to spend time and
    learn yourself so you can help them.</p>

    <p>Since you have horses, are they kept
    together? Seeing you handle and halter your
    horses will them to learn you will not hurt
    them.   If you are handling horses,
    these guys should be no different.
      I have an abused mustang that was
    very hard to handle and even thou I don't
    ride him I still push him around, move him,
    and make sure he sees me as his leader and as
    a higher horse.   But he is much
    like a pet.   Treating them like a
    pet is not bad if you can do the other things
    they need.   If I let this mustang
    go for a year without handling him he would
    be near impossible to handle, but I do his
    feet, I give him shots, I doctor his cuts, so
    I have to spend some time maintaining my
    higher position so he will allow me to do
    those things.   It does not matter
    what you use them for, my point was you have
    to spend as much time as needed to get the
    job done so you can care for them.
      Unfortunately, there are not
    short cuts with horses that don't involve
    brutal means, force and pain.   So
    to avoid those methods, you need to spend
    time and understanding.   There are
    many other good sites out there so read lots,
    but you have to do with horses to learn, just
    reading makes it sound so easy and simple,
    but there much more.   If you have
    raised kids or know someone who has, can you
    imagine someone writing and saying my child
    is 16 years old and won't listen to me, how
    can I get her to listen?   I feel
    that way sometime when people write and say
    my horse won't ???, can you tell how?</p>

  <h3><u><strong>Rearing:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>If a horse is rearing you are causing it.
    It appears you have prepared this horse so it
    does not know what you want or you have shown
    it that you are the leader or it was weaned
    early and is running to you for protection,
    or you are sacking out too aggressively and
    have not taught it to accept it properly, or
    you are doing something else.   As
    you can tell, everything comes back to you, a
    horse is only a reaction to what we do, so if
    we get the wrong response then we did not
    teach it right or did not prepare the horse
    right, or you are not doing something right.
      This is a young horse and is
    trying to learn, but someone has to talk to
    him in horse talk not in human talk.
      You are this horse needs to be a
    herd of two, you have know how to behave and
    act in a herd.   Read my
    horsemanship page on my site.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>This is not a horse problem it is a people
    problem.<br>
    The people leading him are the problem.
      This happens a lot in barns where
    horses have multiple handlers.
      Every person handles a horse
    differently, some worse than others.
      Not sure what a lead shank is but
    if that is stupid chain over the nose or
    under the chin, commonly known as a stud
    chain, then you are going to make this horse
    mean and soon he will be striking more.
      Pain is often substituted for
    lack of knowledge or lack of ability.
      The second thing that I
    absolutely disagree with is separating the
    horse from the herd, that is another thing
    that will raise the drive of the horse and
    will make him harder to handle.
      If the barn manager is stupid to
    lead a horse then don't make your horse pay.
      Horses step on people and act
    like horses, all horses will rear if they are
    allowed or caused to rear, just another
    example of horses having to pay for people
    not knowing what they doing.
      Getting kicked out this barn may
    be the best thing for your horse.
      If others can't handle your horse
    then maybe you be handling him more.
      Locking a horse up, away from a
    herd is wrong and the horse does not deserve
    this.   The fact that the "barn
    manager" is now scared of him, is probably
    the reason he did what he did.
      Perhaps she should stick to
    management and leave the horse handling to
    people who are not scared.   The
    old saying "you can't fix stupid" seems to
    pop up a lot in the horse world.
      So don't try and fix a horse that
    is not broke.   Good luck trying to
    fix people with titles like barn manager,
    trainer, life long horse owner, and I been
    riding horses since I was kid people....</p>

    <p>When horses develop problems or issues as
    we call them, they are normally caused by the
    person handling them.   If a horse
    rears with me, I caused it.   If a
    horse was not rearing before, then I caused
    it.   A horse is nothing but a
    reflection of it's handling.   Yes
    there are a few exceptions, but very far and
    few.   So I would say your trainer
    caused this or let people ride the horse that
    caused it.<br>
    <br>
    If I gave a horse to a trainer, which I would
    never do, and the horse developed a bad
    habit, it is only reasonably that the trainer
    caused it.   If you give me a horse
    and it was not rearing before and then I call
    you and say, your horse is rearing, guess who
    caused this.   This seems really
    simple to me.   Then again, if I
    was charging you for a service and I knew you
    were not too horse savvy, then I could tell
    you, opps, for no reason, your horse started
    rearing, but it is not me, it is your
    horse....   I say it all the time,
    it is never the horse's fault.<br>
    <br>
    I don't know the trainer, I don't know the
    horse, I don't know you, so please don't tell
    me how good your trainer is, how good your
    horse is, it is my opinion that the horse is
    never to blame and that horses do not start
    something unless someone has taught it
    them.<br>
    <br>
    I have a section on rearing on my site, read
    it and it might give you some ideas.
      A horse will not rear if he can
    go forward and does not feel trapped.
      Most rearing is due to bits that
    hurt, improper training, and a lack of
    understanding of a horse.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>This can be one of the most dangerous
    things a horse does. Never pull on both reins
    together, only one rein so the horse will
    always turn and not back up and rear.
      It is harder for a horse to rear
    when going forward or left or right.
      However this is not a easy fix
    and I would need more info to try and help.
      I ask that you provide the
    requested information that is posted where
    you type your question.</p>

    <p>This is a serious and dangerous problem.
    You did not provide the requested information
    that I requested at the top of where you type
    the question.<br>
    <br>
    Horses normally don't flip over unless they
    are pulled and are give too much pressure and
    they cannot find release from the pressure.
      I need more info to answer this
    better.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>First it is a young horse and does not
    know much. Rearing is a thing that is caused
    normally by rough hands, painful bits, poor
    riding or lack of understanding of a horse.
      A horse will not rear if it can
    move forward.   So when it rears it
    is saying I don't want to go where you are
    trying to force me, I am nervous or scared
    and don't know what you want, so since I am
    confused and don't know what to do, and since
    I can't go forward or backwards or left or
    right, I will try and go up to get you to
    stop pressure.   You need to
    realize that you are causing this and you can
    stop it or prevent it.</p>

    <p>ANSWER: This is your problem and not the
    horses. Most rearing is caused by rough hands
    and someone being too tight on the bit.
      A rear happens with a horse wants
    to go forward and a rider tries to hold him
    back, if you understood horses better you
    know that holding a horse too much will cause
    a rear.   If   you
    redirect the horse and not try and hold him
    back the rearing would stop.   You
    also said the horse does not care about
    hurting itself, of course she does, no horse
    wants to hurt themselves, but with a bit
    comes pain and with pain a horse does things
    that will hurt them.   A horse will
    run off a cliff if you scare it enough or
    cause enough pain.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a 16yr
    old TB mare. I have known her for 7 years
    now. I bought her about 5 years ago and had
    her for 3 of those years and never had an
    issue with her. She was stolen from me and I
    just recently found her and got her back. For
    some reason When ever she is tied she freaks,
    rears, falls, and gets hurt. I have been
    tacking her in her stall or just having her
    stand with the rope over her neck but I
    really want to be able to work through her
    problem without her getting hurt! What should
    I do?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You say she
    freaks out, she is scared and may be telling
    you that she does not trust or respect you
    enough to be tied.   I have a web
    page on tying a horse, read that and it will
    help.<br>
    <br>
    You say she rears, I say you are not tying
    her short enough to stop her from rearing.
      Tie her short with a good rope
    halter, NO buckles or snaps that can break,
    and when she pulls freaks or falls, just
    stand back and DON'T get involved or help,
    let her figure out that pulling gets her
    nothing.   Just be there in case
    you need to help, but don't help unless she
    stops moving and jumping.   You
    have to make sure and tie her safely so can't
    get hurt when she jumps around, she will get
    tired of pulling.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hi, My 14 month
    old shetland filly has just started rearing
    when I go into the field. The previous owners
    said they played the first Parelli game with
    her, and she is a quite a clingy horse. She
    prefers humans to the other horse in her
    field. If I walk around the field she follows
    me everywhere and as soon as i start to walk
    away from her she starts to charge, ears back
    and and rears at me, what is making her
    change so quickly. As soon as she does this,
    i will get my her side, crouch down to her
    level and stroke her neck and she stops. When
    i stand up again, se will graze around me and
    stay near but once again, as soon as I am far
    enough away for her to gather up a charge,
    she comes for me again. Is it a game to her?
    I know she needs a lot more training.
    thanks.<br>
    <br></p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It sounds like
    she is playing, but she can hurt you.
      I play chase with my horse but if
    he gets too horsey I have to shut him down.
      If she accidentally gets too
    close and hits you in the head or back she
    will break something on you or kill you.
      She needs to taught that rear is
    unacceptable. I am sure you like that fact
    that she follows you, but charging and
    rearing has too many ways to go bad.
      And, more importantly, she is
    learning and will soon learn that she scares
    you or she can make you move and then she
    will think she is higher and it will move
    from playing to telling you to move and when
    you don't she will try and make you by
    charging and rearing, then she will get
    labeled as being mean or aggressive.<br>
    <br>
    Teach her that she can't and that you can
    stop her so there is no confusion that you
    are higher and you are in charge.
      The fact that you are crouching
    down to her level tells me you don't
    understand horses and are treating this horse
    like a dog.   You may think you are
    being nice and clam by getting down, I think
    the horse see this as she is making you
    submit and she is making you say you are
    sorry.   It does not matter what
    you think you are doing or what you plan to
    do, it only matter what the horses thinks.
      A horse only respects stronger
    and smarter, it only respects you if you can
    move their feet, back them down, make them
    yield to you, control their movement...horses
    DO NOT respect love, carrots and pets...
      this is horse is not mean, is not
    doing anything wrong, it is simply being a
    horse and you are being a human, the problem
    is both of you are working from your
    beliefs..... that is the problem, you are
    smarter and need to really understand a horse
    so you can work from their point of view not
    yours.</p>I would say that 85% of all people
    with horses are scared of them. That is sad
    for horses.   If people understood
    them, they would know that a horse is only a
    horse and is only dangerous when handled by
    people that don't understand them.<br>
    <br>
    Knowledge is power and knowing helps you deal
    with fear. You may not agree with this but
    your horse flipped over because of what you
    did.   Everything a horse does is
    because of what we do.   I don't
    want to debate this with you, but I assure
    you that if had not done what you did the
    horse would not done what it did.  
    You could have slowed down, made sure the
    trail was safe, kept better balance, seen the
    danger before it happened, helped the
    horse....what you did is saddled, ran the
    horse, made it do what it did, put it in the
    situation for what happened... you may not
    want to admit it, but it is true, you had all
    the options and the had NONE, it did what you
    told him, made him or caused him to
    do.   This is why people get hurt
    and fear horses and it is never the horses
    fault.<br>
    <br>
    Horse know fear since it is the opposite of
    assertiveness, control,
    aggressiveness.   Horse only
    respect strong leaders that push them,
    correct them and make them listen... you will
    never see a lead horse, begging asking,
    offering treats to get a horse to trust
    them.... the lead horse will push, kick, and
    Make the horse know who is leader and then
    the lower horse leans, respect and feels
    better and safer... yet people continue to
    try and be nice, ask, give carrots, beg, be
    soft and easy, horses see all this as
    Weakness and will walk all over these
    people.<br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    This horse is rearing since you do nothing
    but get scared when he does it. If you hit
    his butt, made him run, made him turn and
    flex his head and did it with force,
    assertiveness and made it clear to the horse
    that rearing gets him grief, gets him work,
    gets him tired and gets you upset, then he
    would learn Rearing is not fun and he will
    NOT want to rear.   Now, he rears,
    you get nervous, you freeze, you don't know
    what to do, you probably get off or try and
    talk nice to him or let him stand and
    relax..........all bad and all tell the horse
    Rearing is good, rearing gets him to relax,
    rearing is not bad so why should he stop...
    basically you are teaching him to
    rear.  <br>
    <br>
    Read, study and learn horses, learn about
    herd behavior, learn about all the things I
    discuss on my horsemanship page,  
    spend time with horses and once you really
    understand them you will know how to push
    back and show them you are boss and all your
    horse problems will go away and so will your
    fear.

            problems and many of the horses and
            riders had great trainers.
              A trainer is not
            responsible for every problem of
            their student or the horse that the
            student is riding.
              However, if your trainer
            rides the horse and it rears, I would
            say it is your trainers fault since
            he was riding.   You said
            the only time the horse acts right is
            with your trainer.   Which
            makes my point.   If your
            rears with you, you are causing it.
              If your does anything
            wrong when you are riding it,it is
            your fault.   I say it to
            most everyone and say it to myself,
            "It is never the horse's fault".
              <br>
            <br>
            So if you want to believe that my
            answer was not helpful, I can't help
            you.   I can't help people
            that just want to make excuses, blame
            the horse and not accept
            responsibility for causing the
            problem.   Your trainer is
            being paid, which makes her your
            employee, which means that she may
            not be in the position to be as
            direct or honest with you as I am.
              I don't know you, I have
            never seen you ride and have no
            reason to argue or get into a debate
            with you.   I am trying to
            help your horse.   Your
            horse is trying to tell you
            something.   He is rearing
            and it is dangerous for you.
              So you keep thinking it
            is the horse or believe that I don't
            what I am talking about, but you are
            the one that is going to get hurt if
            you don't change something you are
            doing.   <br>
            <br>
            I will bet you a plane ticket and
            expenses that I got on your horse it
            would not rear!   You can
            believe it or not, but just for the
            sake of trying to help your horse, if
            your horse did not rear when I rode
            it, would you then agree that the
            problem is you and not your
            horse?<br>
            <br>
            So since you horse does not do this
            when your trainer is there and does
            when you it is with you without your
            trainer, what is the difference?
              Look to yourself for the
            problem.   Work on yourself
            and your horse will get better.
              If you understood horses
            better, you would already know
            this.<br>
            <br>
            Lastly, you said you don't find my
            answer helpful, that is exactly what
            you horse is telling you.
              He does not find what you
            doing helpful, he is confused, he is
            scared, he is resistant and he is
            telling you that YOU are doing
            something wrong.   Stop
            looking at this like a horse problem,
            look at as your horse sees it.
              I assure you, your horse
            sees this as a people problem and I
            agree with your Horse!ANSWER: Like
            most people that don't understand
            horses, they always look to the horse
            for the problem.   I know
            that it is never the horse's fault.
              I would say it is you
            daughters issue or others if others
            ride or handle the pony.
              All ponies tend to get
            bad reputations, they are bought and
            sold, they are owned by people that
            think they are a cute pet and know
            little about horses, then after the
            newness wears off, they are sold and
            they cycle starts over, I have never
            known a pony that did not have at
            least 3 or 4 previous owners.
              It is a bad cycle for a
            horse and they get bitter and
            resentful and then to start biting,
            kicking and rearing.   This
            is from years of abuse and neglect by
            people that don't understand horses.
              Oats probably have
            nothing to do with this, lack of
            exercise, lack of proper handling,
            lack of consistent handling, rough
            and inexperience riders and hands are
            more likely the cause of these
            problems and it will get worse.</p>My
            opinion, which you asked for is based
            on my experience.   Much
            like my opinion of your response.
              You want to make this
            about you and your daughter.
              This horse is screaming
            that he is confused, frustrated or
            annoyed, all of which is dangerous.
              A pony kick can kill as
            fast as an adult horse kick.
              A pony rear can quickly
            turn into a flip over or a blind run
            all of which can hurt or kill a
            child.   <br>
            <br>
            So you feel good that you defended
            your pony and your daughter. My
            experience with MOTHERS are that they
            are blinded with "motherly instinct"
            much like a fearful horse, they react
            instinctively without much
            forethought.   Your
            daughter is NINE years old and you
            are calling her experienced.
              That is just ignorant and
            shows your lack of knowledge. I have
            been riding horses for almost 40
            years and I still have much to learn.
              I can not help a horse
            when people such as yourself want to
            take any advice as criticism, make it
            personal and refuse to admit that
            they don't understand horses and
            don't understand how dangerous they
            can be.<br>
            <br>
            My so called bias opinion is from
            years of experience of seeing ponies
            and horses hurt kids and then seeing
            parents blaming the ponies for
            hurting their kids, blaming trainers
            for not training the pony correctly,
            blaming the doctor, the system, and
            anyone else that will transfer the
            responsibility to anyone other than
            themselves.   <br>
            <br>
            So you go ahead and ignore my "bias
            opinion" and when this pony hurts
            your daughter, you and I will know
            that I tried to warn and educate you,
            but you knew better.   If
            you care to read my web site, you
            might learn something about horses
            that you did not know.

    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>First thing you need to do is understand
    horses better. All horses are spooky. That is
    how they survive.   So being scared
    is very natural.   Your horse does
    all these things since she does not see you
    as her herd leader.   All horses
    see the world as a herd, they have to try and
    be higher all the time, so unless you tell
    her you are higher she will never stop being
    scared with you.   She has to feel
    safe with you and she can't until she sees
    you as a leader.   You can't show
    her you are a leader until you understand how
    horses think and how they pick a leader.</p>
    <hr>
    Hey Michaela, this is a you issue and not the
    horse. You use terms like embarrassed,
    ungrateful, horrible and bad horse.
      Those are your terms not a horse.
      Your horse is only being a horse.
      He is nervous since he does not
    have a good strong leader that he can trust
    and feel safe with.   He is nervous
    and scared since he knows you are not the
    leader so he has to be the leader and always
    be on guard.   If you require more
    from him, make him listen, move his feet,
    stop babying him, he will see you as a
    leader, then he will trust you, then he will
    feel safe with you and will not need to worry
    about everything since he knows you will take
    care of him.   He will never do
    this if you keep being too easy, too nice and
    not requiring something from him.
      Move his feet, make him back up,
    lunge him, round pen him, show him you are a
    higher horses and he must respect you.
      He needs to pay attention to you
    and not other things, if he ignores you, pays
    attention to other things, then put him to
    work, back him up, make him circle you, move
    his feet, then he will see you as leader and
    he will get better.   <br>
    <br>
    You only make him worse by trying to be too
    nice. You raised him and have been a friend,
    but he does not care or know what that means,
    he only knows that you and him are a herd of
    two and you are either higher or lower.
      He is treating you as a lower
    horse, so you need to help him see you as
    higher, stronger, a good leader, who will
    protect him, but you have to move his feet to
    show him this.<br>
    <br>
    Read my sacking out section on my
    horsemanship page, this will help with his
    fear.
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: Well this is tough one. I agree
    with your husband in part. A horse is not a
    four wheeler. A four wheeler needs gas, an
    engine and tires to run.   A four
    wheeler can be turned off with a key.
      A horse is a living creature that
    can run, stop and turn when it wants, you
    can't turn it off and it will kill or hurt
    you without ever thinking about it.
      Fear keeps up safe and it keeps
    horses alive.   A horse has to live
    with fear every single day and it can not
    escape, but it keeps on doing it.
      A horse will give you things no
    one or nothing else can give you.
      The reward is high and so is the
    risk.   If you that scared of a
    horse, then you are that scared of other
    things in your life.   Horses make
    us grow, face our fears, teach us about
    ourselves and make us better.<br>
    <br>
    Can't think of one person that has never been
    scared of a horse, I am always aware that a
    horse can hurt me if I am not careful, aware,
    on top of my game and fully aware of many
    things, but the reward if worth the
    risk.<br>
    <br>
    So the choice if yours, you can not face this
    fear, take the easy way out and get out of
    horses. Which may the best thing for you. Or
    you can attack your fear, learn from it, grow
    and know that you the reward if worth the
    risk.   No can make that choice for
    you.<br>
    <br>
    The safe choice if get out. The odds of
    getting hurt are high, especially if you
    approach this like a part time hobby. Owning
    horses is a lifestyle not a hobby.
      Those that do it as a hobby make
    their horses pay.   Horse needs
    time, lots of it.   The first time
    you got behind the wheel of a car you were
    scared, but you did it and now don't think
    twice about it.   I get on a horse
    like I get in a car.   It has
    become second nature and almost automatic,
    but has taken many years.<br>
    <br>
    So not sure what answer you are looking for
    or maybe looking for me to make this
    difficult choice for you, but I think you
    lose in many ways if you give up and let
    horses out of your life.   The more
    you have to work for something the more you
    appreciate it.   I would bet that
    at least 50 percent of horse people are STILL
    scared of horses and probably in the 75
    percent area, but they still do it.<br>
    <br>
    You will not meet another creature that is
    has fearful as a horse, they big, strong,
    fast, and beautiful, but they live in
    constant fear everyday and they have no
    choice.  </p>

          <td valign="top">
            <p>If you read more, educate yourself
            more, watch videos, go to horse
            clinics, hang out at barns, handle
            lots of horses, turn horses out, hang
            out in pastures with horses running
            free, watch others handle horses,
            take lessons from a Horseman or
            Horsewoman and not just a trainer.
              As you discover how
            complex horses are you will gain
            confidence, the more you hand out
            with horses you will see that they
            are not mean and do not do much
            unless there is a reason to do it.
              Doing ground work on
            different horses will help you build
            confidence, no two horses are a like,
            they all teach you something
            different, so working one or two
            horses that you get comfortable with
            does not help, it actually may make
            it worse.   Get in a group
            that do horse things.
              Horses have to fully
            encompass your life, you have to try
            and become part horse, to understand
            them you have think like them.
              Owning a horse, being
            able to ride a calm trained horse
            does not make you a horse person.
              The more you learn about
            the horse, the more you will realize
            how little you know about
            horses.<br>
            <br>
            Confidence comes from doing, not
            watching, not reading, not someone
            telling you, go do, spend every free
            minute with horses, hand out with
            them, they will teach you.<br>
            <br>
            There are several websites out there
            dealing with fear, horses, groups,
            questions, the information is
            limitless.   Anyone can
            become good with a horse but to
            really understand them, that only
            comes with time.   Time
            riding, time training, time watching,
            time feeding, time caring for them,
            time depending on them, time getting
            almost hurt by them, time healing
            after they hurt you, catching them in
            pasture, time grooming them, time
            picking their feet, time doctoring
            their injuries, time freezing
            bringing them hay in the rain, time
            walking them when they colic, time
            hearing them whinny when they see
            you, time with them knowing you are
            upset and the nuzzle you to make you
            feel better, lots and lots of time.
              I can't teach these
            things, I can't explain horses in an
            email when it takes a lifetime to
            learn them.<br>
            <br>
            All I can say is you are not the
            first or only person to be scared of
            horses.   Many before you
            have overcome this fear and reaped
            the rewards of having horses in their
            lives.   Many have gotten
            hurt and have gotten out of horses
            forever.   This is a choice
            that each person has to make.
              I can't imagine my life
            without horses so I am bias.<br>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I believe no
    horse is past help.   You want to
    focus on the horse as the issue, I normally
    focus on the people as the issue.
      My first guess would be the
    trainer is not very good, or she has not been
    working with the horse as much as she said.
      Horses get better very fast.
      If you have not been at each
    lesson and have not seen progress at each
    lesson then I say it is trainer and not
    horse.   All horses are spooky and
    they stay spooky or get worse depending on
    who is handling them.   His size is
    probably intimidating and he will know it, if
    someone does not push him hard.<br>
    <br>
    Five months of training is crazy in my book,
    you should cutting cattle and doing advanced
    trails by now. I have an article on picking a
    trainer that you may want to read, it is on
    my articles page of my site.<br>
    <br>
    The ear pinning is normal horse behavior, he
    is doing it since it has not been make clear
    that he cannot do it. I don't care if he was
    abused or not, he is a horse and needs to be
    treated like a horse, a lower horse and the
    people handling him need to make it clear if
    he threatens or pushes he gets pushed and
    moved fast and hard so it is clear that he
    does not push people.<br>
    <br>
    I hear your story over and over, I can bet,
    with a 90% chance of being right, that this
    is a people problem and not a horse problem.
      This horse may need some tough
    love to teach it and not so much feeling
    sorry for it.   Too many people
    think being tough on a horse is mean, it is
    needed and will save their life.
      You cannot expect the horse to
    change if you keep doing the same thing.
      Your trainer should have figured
    this out by now, but it sounds like she is
    doing the same thing since the horse is doing
    the same thing and not getting better.<br>
    <br>
    It could be medical, it could mental, but I
    would bet it is people.<br>
    <br>
    When I hear about horses like this, if they
    are close and I go work with them, the horse
    changes in about 10 mins and the owners can't
    believe it.   This horse needs
    strong leadership, good direction, good
    sacking out to help him deal with his fear
    and not so many excuses on why he can't get
    better.<br>
    <br>
    Read my web sit, take some notes and then ask
    your trainer some educated questions and see
    if you get reasonable answers or if you get
    double talk about this horse is different,
    this horse was abused, this horse has
    something wrong with him.....
      this is an easy way to blame the
    horse and not admit that you (the trainer)
    are doing something wrong.<br>
    <br>
    Don't give up on this guy, get involved,
    read, learn and understand horses so you can
    help this horse and not depend on others to
    tell you what they cannot do.<br>
    <br>
    that is my take,</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Well anytime a horse is shaking with fear,
    the last thing you want to do is get on his
    back.   Fear is normal, but shaking
    is a sign of a horse about to blow.
      As for breaking him.
      You can try some good sacking
    out.   I have a section on this on
    my site on my horsemanship page.
      By increasing his fear and then
    removing it, you will build confidence.
      If his ground manners are great,
    then put a saddle on him while doing ground
    work.   Get him great on ground
    manners while wearing a saddle.
      He will soon learn that the
    saddle is nothing that is going to hurt
    him.<br>
    <br>
    When doing your sacking out, get him to let
    you learn on his back, sit on his back and
    lay on his back, with NO saddle. So he can
    learn that being on his back will not hurt
    him.<br>
    <br>
    Then after he is good at both of those, then
    you add the saddle with you in it.
      If you go slow and prepare him
    good, he should be fine. At anytime he starts
    showing lots of fear or any shaking (you
    should see fear before he shakes and stop)
    take him back to something he is comfortable
    with.   So whenever he gets scared,
    go back to something easy that he is really
    good at, so he learns that he can be scared
    and you will take care of him.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hey Rick,<br>
    <br>
    I'm hoping you can help me. I'm 44-years old,
    I grew up with horses because my Grandfather
    raised Quarter Horses for a living, so I grew
    up in the saddle. I can say I'm not the
    greatest horseman, but I've broke a few colts
    with very good results.<br>
    <br>
    Now it is many years later, and I just
    acquired a 4-year-old Mustang gelding, Wiley.
    A friend of mine did a Mustang rescue and got
    a mare. A couple months later, she had a
    colt. Now he is mine.<br>
    <br>
    My friend told me stories of him lying next
    to him in the pasture when he was first
    born.........and so the story goes. Spoiled
    rotten.<br>
    <br>
    I just got him last Sunday, and they brought
    another horse along just so he could get
    acclimated. She is a QH mare.<br>
    <br>
    The first day went well. Took a trail ride;
    he followed behind her. Second day, I
    pony-led my 12-year-old son, who has no
    experience, on a trail ride. I rode the mare,
    he rode Wiley. Nothing exceptional except bad
    manners, pinning of the ears, and Wiley
    kicked at the mare when she got behind him.
    (not that that was actually good!)The third
    day did not go so well.<br>
    <br>
    I took him off by himself. I noticed a
    definite attitude change just leading him
    around. He was miffed that I would ask him to
    do anything, and at that point I wouldn't
    doubt that he may bite me. He would pin his
    ears back if he knew I was looking at him.I
    responded with my voice and a a firm grasp on
    his head. I proceeded to saddle him up and
    got on. I asked him to move
    forward..........he would not budge. I turned
    his head to the left, I turned his head to
    the right. I kicked; he bucked. I smacked him
    with the reins; he bucked. I had someone lead
    him forward. He finally walked, but then
    stopped and LAID DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
    <br>
    At that point, I was dismayed and really mad.
    I made him get up and smacked him with the
    reins and very quickly made him work for me.
    I spent the next 2 hours on the ground
    leading him in circles, stopping, starting,
    backing up, and then I tied him up for
    awhile. He actually had a change of heart and
    was responding without attitude. I didn't get
    back on because there was no one around and
    because I wasn't sure if I really should.
    Wiley needs to get the fundamentals of being
    a domesticated horse.<br>
    <br>
    Now that I know what I'm dealing with, I need
    to stop and and back up and figure out how to
    deal with him. I have never had to deal with
    other people's problems. If my horse had a
    problem, either it was me as the cause; and I
    knew it and could fix it, or just a matter of
    time with a green-broke horse. This is
    different.<br>
    <br>
    He is kept in a pasture, and has been all of
    his life. The first couple of days here, he
    was pastured with cows. When I turned him
    out, he showed his aggressive nature toward
    them. I get that, but I have never been
    around a horse that treated ME as the
    herd.<br>
    <br>
    Today, when I went out into the pasture, he
    ran at me. I turned around, put my hand up
    and said whoa! He did. But not the thing I
    want to happen when I walk into a
    field.<br>
    <br>
    His previous owners tell me, "he will never
    hurt you", but I think he is a dangerous
    horse. At least he is not the kind of horse I
    am used to.<br>
    <br>
    My 90-year-old Grandpap has strong advice on
    how I should deal with him. He has had
    success. But I think I should start with
    isolation. Wiley cannot be in the position
    bully another horse or cow or me. I have to
    quit being afraid and stand up to him.<br>
    <br>
    What is your advice?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> lol, pretty sure you
    are not going to like my answer, but I will
    give it to you.   Growing up in
    Texas and at our age, showing a horse who is
    boss was accepted and normal business.
      This works, but it is not the
    best way, it is harder on horse and human and
    you will not get as good as horse in the end.
      The hard way worked back in the
    day since we used horses everyday, worked
    them hard and spent lots of time in the
    saddle and working the horse.
      Nowadays we want this to work
    when a horse is a part time gig, ridden a few
    times a month, fed high quality feed and
    grain and we keep horses in stalls away from
    herds where they can't be with other horses
    and get lessons and exercise.<br>
    <br>
    What you called spoiled, lots of people call
    imprinted or desensitized.   A
    horse that has not been raised with hard
    handling does not fear/respect people as a
    horse that has been handled kindly and maybe
    cuddled too much.<br>
    <br>
    You don't understand this horse since you
    have not learned the horse language, herd
    talk, herd behavior and what I think is the
    better way to work with horses.
      The old way and what your grandpa
    is telling you is probably to stub this horse
    up, isolate him, withhold food and water,
    sack him out and show this horse who is boss
    and not to mess with you.   This is
    called breaking a horse, breaking his spirit
    and breaking his resistance and basically
    making him a well behaved slave.
      This worked for years and brutal
    methods have been around as long as horses.
      The new way, that most old timers
    don't like, don't want to accept, think is a
    waste of time, is what I believe is a better
    way.   <br>
    <br>
    You are looking at this horse as a beast of
    burden and a tool for you to use as you see
    fit. My way and most Natural Horsemen believe
    if you take more time, use understanding,
    work with the horse's natural instincts, you
    get a better horse, it is less dangerous for
    you and horse, and it makes you better
    because it.   <br>
    <br>
    You have treated this horse like a master and
    slave relationship, a Mustang is wild bred
    and has very strong herd instincts, he is
    comfortable with herd behavior, survival,
    does not like or trust humans, and will be
    quicker to fight if cornered, mistreated or
    man-handled.   On the flip side, he
    will be the best horse you ever had if you
    talk to him in his language, gain his trust
    and respect, show him that you understand him
    and act more like a horse and herd.<br>
    <br>
    So the choice is yours. You can use the old
    ways and fight with this horse, break him,
    tie him, beat him, abuse him, tear down his
    spirit and rip away his soul and the beauty
    of the horse, or you can use your head more,
    take more time, learn from him, become a
    better horseman, not use brute force and pain
    methods and in the end have a great horse
    that is your partner, who sees you as his
    herd leader and not a brutal human predator
    that he only listens too from fear.<br>
    <br>
    I have lots of information on my site, tell
    your grandpa to read it, he will learn some
    things and see some things he agrees with and
    will see some things that he thinks is horse
    pucky.   Older horsemen knows what
    worked and don't see much reason to change,
    especially if it takes more time.
      Back in the day, horses were
    money, work and livelihood, making it better
    for them was not a concern.
      However, with knowledge and the
    new age of information, better ways have been
    proven to be more effective, longer lasting,
    safer and better for man and horse.
      Check out my site and feel free
    to write back.   <br>
    <br>
    If you don't have time, want fast results and
    don't care about this horse, don't mind
    fighting some bucks and taking risk on you or
    your horse getting hurt, then don't waste
    your time on my site, it will not be helpful.
      My site is more Natural
    Horsemanship orientated, so it contradicts
    the old ways and appears not to make sense to
    those who believe and still practice the old
    ways.<br>
    <br>
    For your horse's sake, I hope you read my
    site.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck to you and your horse.</p>

  <h3><u><strong>Stall Behavior:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>STOP scaring your horse. She is in a new
    place, has been abused and neglected by race
    horse people and now she has another human
    scaring her.   Treat your horse the
    way you would want to be treated if you were
    a horse.   You say she has scraped
    herself twice, no she has not, you have
    scared her and made her in fear of her life
    so she reacted like a horse, YOU caused her
    to get hurt.   Too bad she did not
    kick you when you scare her instead of
    running then maybe you would get the idea
    that scaring her is not fair.<br>
    <br>
    How can you say you are afraid of her getting
    her and then you continue to scare her?? You
    caused her to get hurt twice.   You
    also say the gelding is aggressive over food,
    you are causing this too.   Horses
    only fight over food when HUMANs are too lazy
    to feed them correctly.   If you
    put food where horse have to fight to eat
    then they will fight, they are survival
    animals.   If you put enough food
    in different locations so they do not have to
    fight then they do not fight.<br>
    <br>
    Educate yourself about horse better so you
    will stop thinking like woman and stop trying
    to protect a horse from another horse.
      Horses don't need protection from
    horses, they need it from people.<br>
    <br>
    Just to make sure I get this, you make the
    horse stay alone to protect it from a horse
    and then you scare the crap of it with a whip
    so it gets so scared that it hurts itself and
    then tell me that the horse hurt itself and
    you take no responsibility for the injury??
      I think I get it.<br>
    <br>
    If I sound irritated, rude or mean, good! I
    try and be the voice of the horse, if I was
    this horse I would tell you, don't protect me
    from the other horse, protect me from you.
      You lock me up, you keep me from
    my own kind, from my herd, from my safety of
    another horse and then you scare me and push
    into a panic and then blame me for hurting
    myself.<br>
    <br>
    Here is a wild answer to your question. DON'T
    PUT THE HORSE IN THE STALL.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>  </p>

    <p>ANSWER: Sounds like he is stall sour and
    has become protective and aggressive from
    being locked up without other horses.
      He will only get worse.
      He needs a pasture with other
    horses to play, push, fight and get taught
    some manners by other horses... he is still a
    horse and people cannot provide all his
    needs, he is a herd and social animal that
    needs other horses.   This just
    another sad example of people putting horses
    in situations where they have no choice and
    then when they develop bad habits due to the
    conditions they are kept in, people want to
    blame the horse or call him names like mean,
    aggressive, or other names.   This
    could be caused and made worse by people
    correcting, teasing or treat him like his is
    mean, like his reputation calls him.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: I also know it is hard to accept
    that you may be the cause of the problem.
      Unless you are spending 24 hours
    a day with your horse horse, there is no way
    you can say he is not being teased.
      You said he had a large turn out,
    your large, my large and a horse's large is
    very different.   The fact that he
    is hanging out at his gate to charge people
    tells me that it is not that large or your
    horse would not be at the gate.
      There are several options to stop
    the charging but I am sure you have will
    reasons for not doing each of them and the
    horse will continue to be blamed.
      So here are the choices for you
    to tell me why you can't do any of
    them:<br>
    <br>
    -Move the horse<br>
    -Keep people away from the gate<br>
    -Put the horse in a several acre pasture so
    he will not hang out at a gate<br>
    -Spend more time with your horse so he is not
    in his "large turn out"<br>
    -Keep your horse out of his "large turn out"
    more<br>
    -Keep your horse busy with a job so he will
    not make his job protecting his gate to his
    "large turn out"<br>
    -Put your horse with more horses so he will
    have a herd and can be a horse with a job and
    not a guard of his gate to his "large turn
    out"<br>
    -Tell the people that are so scared of this
    horse, the ones that tell you he charges
    them, to stay away from the horse if they
    just want to run and see him charge since
    they are causing and reinforcing this
    behavior<br>
    -Put a video camera up to record all this
    charging and confirm the no teasing is taking
    place (even though you already know this is
    not happening somehow)<br>
    <br>
    As you can see from all my suggestions, this
    is about you, what you do, what you prevent
    and what you control, like most all horse
    problems it is not the horse's fault, this
    horse is forced to live in your world under
    your terms and has no choice.   Of
    course this it never the answer anyone wants
    to hear since they love their horse.. I see
    more horses hurt, killed and mentally abused
    by people that love horses.   A
    horse is happiest with other horses and in
    open areas, horses in pasture and in herd
    normally have no vices or no so called
    problems... why is this????   the
    answer is simple, Less human involvement,
    love and help..   no stalls, no
    blankets, no trimmings, no shoes, no hugs...
      just horses allowed to be horses.
      So please don't tell me how grand
    your horse has it in his "large turn out" and
    then try and find an easy answer for keeping
    a horse caged up and causing vices and
    aggressive behavior and then expect to find
    an easy fix by writing an email to
    someone.<br>
    <br>
    Spend more time with your horse and keep him
    out of his "large turn out" is the best
    advice I can give.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I agree you went
    way too fast and did what I call set the
    horse up for failure.   You want to
    make this a horse problem and I see it as a
    you problem.   You did not spend
    enough time learning and establishing your
    leadership role with this horse before
    handling it in a non controlled environment.
      All horses are stronger and we
    need a cheat like a round pen or enclosed
    arena so the horse cannot get away and get
    release.   You said the horse is
    not broke, I say you are not experienced
    enough to handle an untrained horse.
      This horse is only three so to
    say he is a stud or stallion, I think is
    giving him a tough name, he is still a baby,
    he is young and needs good handling.
      Handling that is fair and done so
    he can understand not done by someone who is
    scared, thinks he is a big bad stud or with
    stud chains or brute force.   Not
    saying you are doing this, but that is
    normally how people want to handle so called
    Stallions.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that you took this horse out too
    early and have now taught it a very bad
    lesson, he now thinks, and I agree, that you
    are not capable of controlling him, he now
    thinks he is stronger, he knows that he can
    get away from you, he now knows that you are
    not a strong leader and that he has to be in
    charge when with you, he now knows that when
    he wants to go somewhere you cannot stop him.
      You see this a he is not trained
    or herd bound, I see it as a horse sees it.
      Because you went fast, and did
    not take the time to do it right you have to
    do much longer, much harder and makes the
    horse pay for your going fast, taking a short
    cut or taking on something that you did not
    know you could succeed at.   Now
    you have work much harder to unteach what you
    have taught.   Now the horse will
    be less likely to trust you, to submit to
    you, to see you as a leader... NOT because he
    is not trained, not because he is herd bound,
    but because a person has put him in a
    situation where he had not choice and he did
    only what he knows to do, be a horse!
      Understanding of a horse is best
    gift you can give a horse.   If you
    were to read my web site, you would know that
    calling a horse names like stubborn,
    untrained, mean, bad or other terms only
    tells me that the person doing the name
    calling does not understand horses.<br>
    <br>
    Handling and controlling horses is about
    understanding them and communication, not
    about blame, fancy equipment, chains or other
    gimmicks.<br>
    <br>
    You made the mistake, you caused what
    happened, you taught the horse bad lessons
    and now the horse learned.   So you
    have learn how to fix it and how not to make
    the same mistakes.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The fact that you asked this question
    tells you are trying and don't understand
    horses.   Pain, whips, scare
    tactics do not help horses, they make them
    scared and insecure and they don't like or
    trust the people that do it.
      Invest some time, read my site,
    understand how a horse thinks and feels, you
    may not have experience, but you can read and
    gain knowledge so you can get experience.
      You would not buy a car that was
    in middle of a highway, having never have
    driven before and then say, I own this car in
    the middle of a highway and I have never
    driven before, can you tell me how to get it
    home.   So don't just start using a
    whip to scare a horse since you don't know
    anything else.   Read and educate
    yourself so you don't make the horse pay with
    pain and suffering from your mistakes.</p>

    <p>ou will like my answer, but this is not a
    horse problem, this is a you issue.
      This horse is just testing and
    pushing you to see how you handle it.
      So far the horse has TAUGHT you
    to feed him while saddling, to groom him, to
    hurt him and to NOT to be consistent.
      He does not know the right
    answer, I don't know the right answer from
    your description, I know what you want, but
    the horse does not know.   He is
    guessing and training you.   He
    tries different things and you try different
    things, so he keeps changing because you keep
    changing.   If you want change in
    your horse, you have to change, but you can't
    change every time you are with him.
      You change by making this clear
    and consistent.   You do the same
    thing the same way until you get the same
    answer.   If you change the
    question your horse will never figure out he
    answer you want.<br>
    <br>
    Horses don't understand punishment, the
    understand discipline, very big difference.
      They need to know what is going
    to happen each and every time.
      There can only be ONE right
    answer.   When you get the wrong
    answer you need to ask the questions again
    again until you get the right answer.
      Too many people ask ten and allow
    ten almost right answers, so the horse is
    confused and guessing each time, he never
    really knows the right answer.   So
    if I ask my horse to walk off and sometime I
    allow him to walk one step, sometime I allow
    him to just back up one step, sometime I just
    allow him to move his head, sometime I allow
    him to push me, sometime he can pin his ears,
    sometime he can't, how in the world is going
    to know that walk off means walk off.<br>
    <br>
    A horse is a reflection of his handling, know
    the horse, know the person.
      Scared, fearful, insecure people
    have the same type of horse.<br>
    Inconsistent, moody, and loud people have the
    same type of horse.<br>
    <br>
    A horse only knows what it is taught.
      The first clue to this is over
    half of all questions I get start with, my
    horse just started this!   If you
    are handling the horse and it did not do it
    before, then it is very obvious that you
    taught it, allowed it, or caused the new
    behavior.   <br>
    <br>
    Be consistent, don't bribe with food, don't
    beat with whips and chains, ask once, tell
    twice, order the third time.   I
    could saddle this horse with none of this and
    if it did happen, I would addressed firmly,
    and forget it, and it would stop.
      The horse would learn very
    quickly that if does this I do this, he would
    learn very fast that one way is easy and one
    way is hard on him.   <br>
    <br>
    Read my sacking out section on my
    horsemanship page, this will help you gain
    more respect from your horse and will help
    you learn to read him and deal with him
    better.</p>

            Your horse has figured this
          out and not sees you as a lower horse.
            Any horse that will defend
          himself or kick or push back will be
          the low horse.   Once your
          horse sees you as low horse, he will
          not feel safe with you, will not trust
          you and will not get any confidence
          from you.   Sacking out will
          help you raise your horse's fear and
          will teach you how to read your horse
          before he blows that way you can calm
          him and help him learn to look to your
          for help.   Also if you do
          not give him direction when he spooks
          (take the slack out of your reins) he
          will feel more scared and will think he
          has to take matters into his own hands.
            When you loosen the reins,
          you tell him that you are lost, do not
          know what to do and do not tell him
          what he should do.   A horse
          needs direction so you don't have to
          correct him.</td>

    <p>This horse is stall crazy, he needs to put
    out in pasture with other horses so he has a
    job and is pushed by higher horses and he
    learns herd behavior.   He has been
    locked up so long he has developed this vice
    and it will cause problems later, so you have
    get him out.   Putting him with
    another horse is good, but put them both in a
    turn out or arena and chase them with a bag,
    scare them so they will run and herd up, make
    them depend on each other so they will start
    watching out, put in an older mare and
    gelding as well, they will chase the little
    one and keep him busy so he will not have
    time to circle, you really need to attach
    this issue or will only get worse and the
    horse will suffer.<br>
    <br>
    Horse abuse really pisses me off, this little
    guy never had a chance since the previous
    owners locked it up and neglected it.
      I hope you can help it.</p>

    <p>I agree you went way too fast and did what
    I call set the horse up for failure.
      You want to make this a horse
    problem and I see it as a you problem.
      You did not spend enough time
    learning and establishing your leadership
    role with this horse before handling it in a
    non controlled environment.   All
    horses are stronger and we need a cheat like
    a round pen or enclosed arena so the horse
    cannot get away and get release.
      You said the horse is not broke,
    I say you are not experienced enough to
    handle an untrained horse.   This
    horse is only three so to say he is a stud or
    stallion, I think is giving him a tough name,
    he is still a baby, he is young and needs
    good handling.   Handling that is
    fair and done so he can understand not done
    by someone who is scared, thinks he is a big
    bad stud or with stud chains or brute force.
      Not saying you are doing this,
    but that is normally how people want to
    handle so called Stallions.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that you took this horse out too
    early and have now taught it a very bad
    lesson, he now thinks, and I agree, that you
    are not capable of controlling him, he now
    thinks he is stronger, he knows that he can
    get away from you, he now knows that you are
    not a strong leader and that he has to be in
    charge when with you, he now knows that when
    he wants to go somewhere you cannot stop him.
      You see this a he is not trained
    or herd bound, I see it as a horse sees it.
      Because you went fast, and did
    not take the time to do it right you have to
    do much longer, much harder and makes the
    horse pay for your going fast, taking a short
    cut or taking on something that you did not
    know you could succeed at.   Now
    you have work much harder to unteach what you
    have taught.   Now the horse will
    be less likely to trust you, to submit to
    you, to see you as a leader... NOT because he
    is not trained, not because he is herd bound,
    but because a person has put him in a
    situation where he had not choice and he did
    only what he knows to do, be a horse!
      Understanding of a horse is best
    gift you can give a horse.   If you
    were to read my web site, you would know that
    calling a horse names like stubborn,
    untrained, mean, bad or other terms only
    tells me that the person doing the name
    calling does not understand horses.<br>
    <br>
    Handling and controlling horses is about
    understanding them and communication, not
    about blame, fancy equipment, chains or other
    gimmicks.<br>
    <br>
    You made the mistake, you caused what
    happened, you taught the horse bad lessons
    and now the learned.   So you have
    learn how to fix it and how not to make the
    same mistakes.</p>Since you have owned the
    horse for the 17 years, you have to try and
    figure out what is casing this.
      It could be something you are
    doing or some type of pain the horse is
    feeling.     Something
    changed to cause this new behavior.
      Without more information, I can't
    really help.   How much handling
    does the horse get, do you only feed and
    groom or is the horse worked or ridden, when
    does this happen, is it consistent, what else
    is happening around the horse when this
    happens, when does it stop, is the other
    horse around, is just doing this to you or
    others, does it stop doing this when you do
    something, is there always food present or
    involved, is there treats involved, does this
    happen in the same location all the time,
    what do you do when this happens, what do
    others do when this happens, how long as this
    been going on..... as you can tell there more
    questions than answers, so trying to give you
    an answer on this without more info is not
    going to be helpful.

  <h3><u><strong>Stallions and
  Studs:</strong></u> 
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>Well first you say he was neglected by the
    last owner and you are trying to get on him
    way too fast.   You are being a
    strong leader, you are not seen as the leader
    since the horse will telling you this by
    kicking and biting.   Just because
    this horse is gelded, it does not mean that
    he suddenly forgets how to be a
    stallion.   It can take months or a
    year for this change to take
    place.   You need to treat him like
    a horse, it does not matter if he is a stud
    or gelding, he gets treated as a lower
    horse.   You cannot be friends or
    nice to this horse until he knows you are the
    boss and decides not to push you or test you
    or move up over you.<br>
    <br>
    You do this by moving his feet, changing his
    direction, stopping him movement and making
    sure he knows you move him he does not move
    you, he does not bite your kick at you unless
    he wants a whole mess of trouble.  
    Trouble like you attacking his butt, you
    making him move that butt away from you to
    avoid getting hit with a rope, teaching him
    that anytime his butts gets near you, you are
    going to hit and get it, then he will not
    have time to think about kicking
    you.     When and if he
    tries to bite you, you drive your elbow into
    his mouth like you are trying to knock out
    his teeth.   It will only take once
    or twice and the biting will be
    done.  <br>
    <br>
    The only way you can help this horse is to
    push him like a crazy man and make him think
    you going to eat him if he messes with you,
    once that point is clear then you can slowly
    get nicer and kinder and start to build a
    relationship, but this horse has to know that
    you can and will get busy if he messes with
    you.   Threats and lite hits or
    slaps will only tell this horse you are weak,
    you have to let this horse know you are the
    boss, you are higher, you can move his feet,
    you can make him uncomfortable, you can make
    him run and if he wants to be comfortable, he
    has to play by your rules.   Tough
    love is what horses understand, it makes it
    clear to them and that is what they do and
    that is what they want.   He is
    being clear with you, he thinks you are
    lower, he thinks you are weak, he thinks he
    can take you, he thinks he can kick you, he
    thinks he can bite you.....he thinks this
    since you have not make it clear that he
    can't do any of those things.<br>
    <br>
    Rick</p>
    <hr>
    This horse is only two, I don't think he is a
    stud until four or five, he is acting like
    any two year old.   He is testing
    to see if you are going to allow him to push
    you around.   You have, so he
    thinks he is higher and now, since he is
    higher, he is telling you what to do, since
    that is what high horses do, and you are not
    listening.   So he is threatening
    and trying to make you do what he wants with
    threats, rearing and biting, if you don't
    listen to him he sill start biting harder,
    kicking and striking.   He is doing
    normal horse behavior and treating you like
    he would any other lower horse.
      He is NOT being mean, a stud or
    crazy, he is just being a horse.<br>

    <p><br>
    When a higher horse tells a lower horse to
    get back or move and the lower horse does not
    listen they get kicked or bit.
      Which is what you should be doing
    to him.   You need to tell him to
    move and when he does not you need to
    discipline him, just like any higher horse
    would.   Since you can't kick him
    you need to use your brain and make him think
    you control him feet, you can make him run,
    you can put enough pressure on him to make
    him feel uncomfortable.   Once you
    show him that you will not allow him to treat
    you like a low horse, then he will stop this
    youngster behavior.<br>
    <br>
    Read my horsemanship page on my site, it will
    explain horses and how they think and live.
    Any threats to you need to be reacted to with
    you pushing harder, faster and making the
    horse move or run, then after a few seconds,
    stop and act as if it never happened, don't
    stay mad, don't take it personal and don't
    try and talk it out, push him, make him move
    away and then go back to what you were
    doing.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hi Rick,<br>
    I am 23 years old. I started working with a
    professional trainer when I was eight. I have
    also worked with other professionals and love
    the natural horsemanship way of training.
      I was reading on your website and
    agree with you on a lot of things.
      I just wanted to see what your
    opinion is.   I have a three year
    old BLM Mustang stud colt (he will get gelded
    let me explain).   He is turned out
    with five other horses, two of which are also
    studs (also going to get gelded).
      He has a lean to, gets fed grass
    hay, and is on 10+ acres to run and play.
      I acquired him and the other two
    through a novice horse owner.   She
    taught them some nasty habits.
      The other two I have been able to
    join up with, halter, and training has been
    wonderful.   However this one in
    particular is displaying strange behaviors
    and I am not sure how to deal with him.
      He is a somewhat "rank" horse.
      He's incredibly dominant and I
    have to watch him like a hawk because he
    tries to seize every second he can to catch
    me off guard.   We have been having
    a large power battle and every time he even
    looks at me goofy I send him off immediately.
      After he settles down the last
    time he disengaged his hindquarters when I
    asked, and   I approached him (I
    still can't touch him by the way) he rolled
    his eyes at me and started to shake his head
    up and down.   My first instinct
    was to send him off because I am so used to
    him threatening me.   Now I am
    wondering if that was the correct thing to do
    or not.   Any insight would be VERY
    VERY appreciated.
        Thank you.<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> It is
    hard to say without seeing, but head tossing
    and throwing can be dominate or it can be
    communicating come, pay attention to me,
    displaying pride.   My Mustang does
    this to me some time, he still thinks he is a
    stud and I ignore it if it is not aggressive.
      He may be telling you that he is
    not willing to be completely submissive,
    which is OK, but it also means he is not
    seeing you as the undisputed leader.
      If he has not attacked you, not
    tried to aggressively bite you, has not
    aggressively backed into you kicking, then he
    does not think he is leader, but it will take
    time to get him to completely submit.
      If you push him away too much he
    will be confused and never understand the
    right answer and will get tired of trying to
    find the right answer, which will lead to
    frustration and then maybe resentment. So you
    have be reading him all the time and willing
    to accept small submissions.   Move
    him but release immediately at any sign of
    submission and let him face you or approach.
      You say he is rank, I say he has
    learned this behavior from inconsistent
    handling and confusion.   He just
    wants to feel comfortable and he body and
    instincts are telling him to take charge to
    feel safe, until someone (another horse)
    shows him they are in charge, they understand
    him, they will be fair and keep him safe, his
    instincts will not allow him to relax and
    give in to this new leader.<br>
    <br>
    You have to read him, pay attention and
    really back off trying to push him and be
    weary of him since he is a STUD, a three year
    old is a young horse, still trying to find
    his place, I don't think a stud is really a
    stud until late threes or four or maybe five,
    treat this horse like a three year old and
    forget he is a stud and you will project,
    subconsciously, that you are fearful, over
    careful, worried, or that you think he is
    RANK.   He is just a horse looking
    for fair and consistent leadership, guidance
    and direction, if you make the right answer
    clear and easy to find, he will come a long
    way fast.   <br>
    <br>
    Studs get this bad reputation for being
    ohhhhhhh so bad, so they get treated that way
    and then become that way, it is a vicious
    cycle for the horse and it is unfair and sets
    them up for failure.<br>
    <br>
    Be safe, be careful but treat him like a
    three year old mare and see if he changes,
    you have to change what you are doing if you
    want him to change.   He sounds
    smart which is why he is not giving in, he
    has figured out people fast, so he will be a
    bigger challenge but will teach you more
    about a horse than anyone ever could.
      Learn from him and pay close
    attention to what he is saying or trying to
    say and don't be so fast to see him as "the
    stud".</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> hey rick,
    thanks for your time. i am 34 years old. i
    have basically no horse experience as far as,
    reading and trouble shooting horse problems.
    i have a 7 year old quarter horse(stud). he
    has been at a race track/training facility
    since november 4th. and recently brought him
    home. i had no problems at the facility
    tacking him up to ride. and even the first
    couple of times here at home. he is now
    starting to resist his bridal. he does not
    want to open his mouth for the bit and once
    he does get the bit in his mouth, he raises
    his head when i try to put the headstall over
    his ears dropping the bit out of his mouth.
    what am i doing wrong and how can i correct
    the situation?<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> You said you are not
    experienced, this horse knows this, how? you
    have taught him, since you don't know how not
    to teach him.   He is feeling more
    comfortable with you, he is seeing and
    learning that he is too safe with you and now
    he has to move to step two.   You
    really need to understand horses better and
    you need to get this guy gelded.
      A horse see the world as his herd
    and you are either higher or lower, NO
    equals.. if you try and be equal he will take
    over.   When he raises his head he
    is testing you and you are failing, when you
    fail you teach him he is smarter and he is
    leader, so he should not listen to you, trust
    you or respect you.   All bad
    lessons, you don't realize you are teaching
    it since you don't enough knowledge or
    experience.   A stud teaches hard
    lessons.   Read my web site, every
    page and get this horse gelded.</p>

    <p>I forgot to give you may standard "There
    is no place for Studs in today's times".
    Being a stud is a bad horse life, they cannot
    be turned out with other horses, they are
    always kept alone, they are not handled the
    same way and lots of people are scared or
    mean to them since they don't understand
    them.   A horse isolated is a
    miserable horse.   A horse needs a
    herd, they need friends and they need time
    with other horses.   Studs are not
    allowed a lot of public events, shows or in a
    lot of barns.   Their drive to get
    to a herd and mares are so strong they ignore
    thinks that can hurt them and will jump a
    fence, run through a fence, get torn up by a
    fence and literally kill themselves to
    escape, so people build higher fences, taller
    walls, tighter living spaces, keep them
    isolated as not to have to deal with the
    drive.   So leaving him a stud for
    a while may be ok, but realize treating studs
    like we treat them end up making them what we
    think they are, mean, angry, dangerous and
    uncontrollable.   I always advise
    to geld a stud, there are plenty of horses,
    too many that go to slaughter, we do not need
    more horses and a studs life is a bad life.
      A gelding is more mellow, more
    consistent and are much better in our
    domesticated world.   Do yourself
    and this horse a favor, geld him and give him
    a herd and a good horse life.
      :)</p>
    <hr>

    <p>At three he is a baby and still very
    influenced by you and his handling.
      So bottom line, do what you do to
    other horses that have worked for you.
      I fed my stud carrots and treats
    from my mouth until he was gelded and he is
    was and is a pocket pony and I got all kinds
    of advice how dangerous he was since he was a
    stud.....needless to say I ignored all that
    free advice from life long horse
    owners...<br>
    <br>
    good luck, give him carrot for me and treat
    him like a young gelding, I am sure you both
    will do fine. :)</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The kicking and pinning and herding is all
    normal. If you understood horses better you
    see this and it would not bother you.
      There is always a chance that
    horses get hurt when they play, fight or
    chase, but they are horses and they need to
    work this out.   The proud cut
    gelding is just showing dominance.
      He is making sure that the new
    horse respects him, moves when he tells him
    to move and does not push or approach him
    unless he tells him too.   All
    normal and needed behavior.   All
    horses are leaders and all are followers.
      <br>
    <br>
    Take the proud cut gelding out and put the
    new horse in the pasture. Let the new guy
    learn the fence line and area.
      Then put out some hay, take a two
    flakes out and make little piles all over,
    make sure they are about 20 feet a part, make
    about 7 to 10 piles out of the two flakes,
    that way the horses will be busy eating and
    not so busy chasing.   Then let
    them out together and stay away!
      Don't get involved, don't try and
    help, don't stand at the gate and watch,
    don't stand by the fence, let them work it
    out without you there trying to help and save
    them.<br>
    <br>
    The horse knows how to run and they may chase
    each other and may push each other off the
    food, but they will work it out it YOU (AND
    OTHERS STAY OUT OF IT.)<br>
    <br>
    The food piles will distract and with you not
    there the new guy will not try and run to you
    for help, he will pay attention, full
    attention to the lead gelding, once he does
    that, he will stop getting chased, kicked and
    bit.   As long as you try to help,
    you make it worse and will end up getting a
    horse hurt.   <br>
    <br>
    Once they work out their initial meet they
    will settle down, but it may take a week or
    two for them to really get close and bond up,
    it is all normal.   When you feed
    them make sure you have multiple piles of
    food far enough apart so they can move and
    push each other around, it is how they show
    dominance and enforce the pecking order.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>ANSWER: I don't think he is reacting to
    smell, I think he is reacting to being locked
    up and only let out for 3 hrs.   He
    is going stir crazy, if there are any older
    geldings in pasture, let him out and they
    will teach him manners.   The
    longer you keep him locked up the worse he
    will get.   He is scared, alone and
    can't rest alone, he needs a herd and other
    horses and he will get mean and dangerous if
    you keep him locked up.   Under two
    most mares will not let him breed them and
    they will teach him some manners.
      Let him out with other horses and
    this problem will go away.This question and
    answer is a perfect example of why people get
    hurt by horses and why horses get a
    reputation of being mean and dangerous.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><br>
    OMG,If you are still alive, you really need
    to be careful about showing a stud "who is
    the boss"   the lesson you will
    learn will be hard and very costly.
      You are in "DANGER".
      Make no mistake, this horse will
    and can kill you whenever he wants.
      I cannot stress this enough.
      I am an experienced horseman,
    this horse could do the same thing to me, but
    I might be able to prevent it a little better
    than you, but I know he could do it if he
    wanted to or if I made him want to.
      You do not have any idea what you
    have taken on or you would not be doing what
    you are doing.   "CHAINS AND HORSES
    ARE BAD".   Using a chain on this
    horse is like shooting a charging bear with a
    BB gun, you are only pissing him off and
    sooner or later he will make you pay,
    severely.   <br>
    <br>
    My first questions is why the hell are so
    intent on putting him in the barn? I am with
    your husband on this.   Is dying
    really worth putting this horse in the barn.
      I am sure you are under the
    belief that you are helping him, you are
    giving him good care, you are trying to teach
    him to respect you...............
      I think you are wrong (possible
    dead wrong) if you think this.
      You are making him mean, you are
    making him not like people, you are making
    him associate people with pain, you are
    showing him that you can't handle him and you
    need two people and chains, you are showing
    him he is stronger than you, you are showing
    that he is in charge and that you can't
    control him.   STOP.....<br>
    <br>
    You said the horse broke out a window, NO he
    did not, you forced him into a place he felt
    trapped, scared, nervous, in pain and he
    panicked and reacted just like any horse
    would.   YOU caused this, You put
    him in the situation where he could only
    fail, you tried to do the right thing and you
    set him up for failure, you taught him that
    not only do you hurt him with chains, but now
    if he goes where you tell him or make him
    that he is not safe and they he may get cut,
    trapped, thrown into a window, you taught him
    this, you put him in the place and HE had to
    pay for your mistakes.   When this
    horse hurts you or kills you, your husband or
    the police or someone will want to kill this
    horse for you, to avenge you, to prevent the
    horse from killing someone else, to show the
    horse who is boss, either way this horse
    loses.
      STOP...................<br>
    <br>
    You did not answer the questions I asked so I
    do not know what your experience is, what
    facilities you have, age and other things, if
    you read where you type your question, I have
    a list of things I need in order to answer
    your question, I only answered you this much
    since I think you are about to die, and that
    is your choice and I really don't care
    (sorry), but the horse you are trying to be
    tough with has no choice, so he pays for all
    your macho mistakes, so in order to try and
    help this horse, I ask you to please stop and
    leave the horse in pasture until you
    understand horses better, herd behavior and
    stud behavior better.<br>
    <br>
    Give me some more background and information
    so I can try and help you help this
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    PS:   Make your husband read this
    so he may be able to put some influence on
    you to save you from yourself.   I
    am sure your intentions are good, but a wild
    unhandled stallion does not give a damn about
    good intentions, he is a horse and that is
    all he knows how to be!!!!<br>
    <br>
    Hope you are not reading this from a hospital
    bed,<br>
    <br>
    This question was answered and since the
    person did not like the answer, and did not
    want to hear she was casing this dangerous
    situation, she did not provide any additional
    information.   And if by some
    chance she does not get hurt she will be very
    lucky.   A 7 year old neglected
    horse who has been left on his own and does
    not like or trust people is now being handled
    by a person who wants to be right and who
    wants to show the horse "who is boss".
      So now the horse is being taught
    that his fears and lack of trust in people
    are confirmed and justified.   Just
    because a horse is gelded, this person thinks
    he is no longer a stud and can be bullied
    around with chains.   Anyone who
    knows horses and has done their homework
    knows that it can take a year or more for a
    stallion to calm down after being gelding,
    especially if the stallion has been a
    stallion for 7 or more years.   So
    gelding a stallion and thinking he is a
    gelding now is a big mistake.
      There are many other ways to get
    this horse to listen and does not involve
    chains, this person, like many horse people,
    think she knows that using stud chains gets
    respect and shows a horse who is boss.
      This person thinks she saved this
    horse and all she has done is move him from
    one abusive and neglected home to another.
      This horse was better off when he
    was left alone in a pasture, now he is being
    dragged around with chains, shoved in dark
    scary barns, caused pain and fear, and put in
    a no win situation.   And when he
    is pushed too far, this so called horse
    person will be hurt or will get someone else
    hurt and then blame the horse, just like she
    blamed the horse in her title "Crazy horse",
    well I say the horse is just a horse and it
    has a "Crazy Owner".   Too bad for
    the horse.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Ummm, this is interesting, since you are
    giving me lots of mixed signals. Normally a
    horse who is aggressive to food will not be
    instantly calm.   You say he is
    perfect in one area and then he is showing
    aggressive behavior.   I treat a
    stallion about the same way as I do other
    horses, with a little less trust.
      The hormones can cause them to be
    a bit unpredictable.   It sounds
    like you have a good grasp of horses and are
    doing lots of things right.   I
    would agree you don't want to fight with a
    stud of you might bite off more than you can
    chew, but this guy in only 3ish, I don't
    think they get real studdish until four or
    five, so I would treat him like a gelding, be
    firm, don't take BS, move his feet and show
    him you are higher and don't treat him
    different than you would any other horse.
      He is still a baby and now is the
    time to impress upon him, "don't mess with
    me".   Now how you do this is up
    for discussion.   If you have had
    success with your method, then I would saw
    stick with it.   Don't use chains
    or more brutal methods just because he is a
    stud.   I see too many studs get
    ruined by over aggressive and heavy handed
    handling since the work "stud" is used.
      This is a young horse, teach him
    like a horse, don't take more or less from
    him and don't worry about making him too
    perfect before training.   I would
    also advise you watch and view training and
    handling, you don't want someone making this
    horse mean from treating him like a stud and
    then you will have to geld him and will still
    have a mean horse.<br>
    <br>
    At three he is a baby and still very
    influenced by you and his handling. So bottom
    line, do what you do to other horses that
    have worked for you.   I fed my
    stud carrots and treats from my mouth until
    he was gelded and he is was and is a pocket
    pony and I got all kinds of advice how
    dangerous he was since he was a
    stud.....needless to say I ignored all that
    free advice from life long horse
    owners...<br>
    <br>
    good luck, give him carrot for me and treat
    him like a young gelding, I am sure you both
    will do fine. :)</p>
    <hr>

    <p>QUESTION: I have a mare and her 5 year old
    stud colt, I weaned him at 7 months. I
    thought. there is a 5 acre cow pasture
    between this young man and his mom, well I
    recently had to put him in with her for a
    day, I caught him nursing, you should have
    seen it! He had on front leg stretched out
    and his chest almost on the ground!! And the
    mare had her leg raised!!Well I stalled him
    for the rest of the day, and continued on to
    check my fencing, and found a trail from his
    pasture straight across to the mare's pasture
    the area was covered in hoof prints. I am no
    detective ,but it appears this guy has been
    getting out and nursing and going back.<br>
    This is hard for me to get my mind wrapped
    around ,surely I would have caught him in the
    last 4 plus years?<br>
    The mare's tits look ok and her bag is much
    smaller than a full bag would be,but she does
    have milk that drip.<br>
    I put this guy back into his pasture, after
    some re-enforcement and to my surprise he is
    a jumper???   an unbelievable
    beauty, the fence is near 5' feet and he
    cleared it like it was a stick on the ground.
    He is lock up right now having a fit.I know I
    am going to have problems and I am in it for
    the long haul , this guy is my pet and is an
    easy ride,easy catch,easy to trim,you can
    crawl underneath him sit under him, just an
    all out gentleman. for a 5 year old, I am
    told he is one of the best.He has not been
    cut, and never covered a mare. How would you
    suggest I go about this weaning? In a manner
    that will not upset the apple cart and damage
    his behavior? My life is chaos right now. all
    night he has bawled and so has the
    mare.Please I need help. I feel so bad.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Why do you care? Let him go, when she
    wants him to stop she will let him know. If
    she gets pregnant she will stop him, I would
    be more worried about him getter he
    pregnant??????<br>
    <br>
    So what if he gets a little milk, what does
    it hurt? I never get this weaning thing that
    people seem to have????<br>
    <br>
    Gee, I wonder what happens in the wild and
    why do not see these "problems"....<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ---------- FOLLOW-UP ----------<br>
    <br>
    QUESTION: I care because I don't want to hurt
    the health of my mare or the colt. 5 years of
    nursing surely can't be good for her or him..
    That is why I was asking you.. Are their
    mares who nurse for 5 years straight ,in the
    wild?? I would think the would breed back at
    foal heat.</p>

    <p>ANSWER:   How will it hurt your
    mare or your horse.   FYI, A horse
    is not a colt after five, at five a colt
    becomes a horse.   But back to your
    questions, I am a big believer that horses
    always do better when we stay out of it.
      My horse nursed until three, the
    only reason he stopped was I moved him to a
    different location from mom.
      Unless you or a vet can tell me
    how this hurts them, I would say stay out of
    it and let them be horses.   Not
    sure it this would happen in wild since lots
    of other factors in wild.   No
    geldings in wild, only one stallion in herd,
    colts are pushed out and mares are bred, no
    humans, all these factors change what happens
    in wild.   <br>
    <br>
    I still think him being a stallion is a much
    bigger problem, why not geld him, he will
    breed her and the baby will have problems and
    may not live, why do you need a stallion, in
    this day and age, no place for stallions in
    domesticated horses.   I would geld
    him and that may fix this and I would ignore
    the milk snacks and let them hang out
    together and be horses.   Keeping
    horses alone and separated are much bigger
    issues and will make both horses more nervous
    and harder to handle and will get them in
    trouble.   <br>
    <br>
    My take is geld him and let them be together
    and stop trying to protect them from some
    perceived danger, that I can't see and you
    have not given me any reason or evidence why
    this is an issue other than you wanting to
    protect, mother or get involved in horses
    being horses.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><u>QUESTION</u>:   Hi,<br>
    <br>
    About two months ago, I purchased my first
    horse, a Thoroughbred from someone who got
    him off the track.   I am not a new
    rider, I ridden most of my life and all sorts
    of hard to ride horses.   Because
    this is my own, I guess I'm at a lost.<br>
    <br>
    From what I understand, he was gelded late
    and still has the built like a stallion. He
    is hard to keep in the paddock because we
    can't have him near any mares, he breaks down
    the fence to get to the mares.   He
    has been fighting with the other geldings in
    his paddock (nasty fights too...the other
    geldings have incredible deep bite marks
    after he's done with them) even though he's
    the new kid on the block.
      Otherwise, I don't have much
    problems handling him.<br>
    <br>
    Under saddle, for the first month and a half,
    he has been a dream. If I keep him working he
    doesn't pay much attention to the mares.
      And he has been getting his lead
    changes.   Recently, we decided to
    work more on the lead changes and getting
    them smoother.   Since that, he has
    decided not to switch from right to left all
    the time and if he does, just the front, not
    the hind.   Sometimes if you ask
    him, he will take the bit and take off.
      He has already taken the bit and
    race away with me and I have been unable to
    stop him, throwing out my back and tearing a
    ligment in my arm.   My coach got
    on him one day and asked and he put up a
    dirty fight including ramming her into the
    wall.   While she got the change
    several times after that, it was a nasty
    fight to get it.<br>
    <br>
    Lately I find him aggressive under saddle. He
    used to be ridden in a snaffle but now I
    can't trust him to ride with that.
      I am not afraid of him and will
    get on but I don't wish to fight with him.
      I have dealt with alot of
    difficult horses but never a dirty fighter.
      As far as the vet can tell, no
    health issues.   We are doing blood
    work to check his testosterone levels but
    that would have no bearing on his attitude
    right now would it?<br>
    <br>
    Any help on what I can do to get him to stop
    taking off and stop fighting dirty would be
    nice. I would like to get back to the lead
    changes again.</p>

    <p><u>ANSWER</u>:   You are not
    going to like my answer. You have had the
    horse for two months, are worried about lead
    changes, have others "fighting" with him, you
    think this is a horse problem, you have made
    several excuses like the bit is not strong
    enough, the horse acts like a stallion, proud
    cut,the horse fights with other horses, he
    has run off on you, the horse hurt your back,
    the horse is fighting dirty and now you say
    "HE" is aggressive in the saddle.
      Geez, I wonder why this could be
    happening now and it was not happening
    before????   I wonder why all these
    problems were not there for the first month
    (before you) and they have just suddenly
    developed????   I wonder who could
    be causing this horse to do all these things?
      <br>
    <br>
    I would hope you open your eyes and see that
    YOU are the problem, you caused these issues,
    you created these problems and blaming the
    horse, the bit, the testosterone, calling
    this horse names like "a dirty fighter" will
    not help you, the horse and will not win you
    any points in my book.<br>
    <br>
    This horse is just a horse and that is all he
    knows how to be.   Your excuses are
    only prolonging the issues and preventing you
    from changing.   A horse is only a
    reflection of the rider.   If you
    are good the horse is good, if the horse is
    bad then you are bad.   You talk
    like you have ridden all kind of horses and
    not had these problems.   That
    tells me that you were never with a horse
    long enough for the horse to figure you out,
    now you have one that you spend more time
    with and it has figured you out.
      I don't know you, but this horse
    is telling you and me that you don't know
    what you are doing.   Your name
    calling and excuses about bits and proud cut
    tell me you don't understand horses.
      You are trying to force things
    without understanding.   You do not
    have a partnership with this horse, you have
    a master and slave
    relationship............and the horse is
    going to teach you that respect works both
    ways.<br>
    <br>
    Anyone that has read my site or articles
    would know that asking me a questions,
    blaming and bashing the horse, is going to
    get you what you give the horse.
      You may not like this answer, you
    may think I am mean, insensitive, a jerk and
    that I don't understand you or that I am not
    helping you and just blaming
    you..........welcome to the world of your
    horse...</p>

    <p>Stop trying to train and change this horse
    and try and get to know him, develop a
    relationship with him, learn his language and
    understand him.... if you do that you will be
    amazed how fast your so called "horse
    problems" will go away.<br>
    <br>
    I address all of your issues on my site, if
    you want to take the time to read it and try
    and understand horses better.</p>

  <h3><u><strong>Training New Horse:</strong></u>
  <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

  <div>
    <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

    <p>Well, this like most horse problems is a
    people problem.   Don't worry about
    what she went through before you, only worry
    about what you are doing.   When I
    read she throws her head in a bit, my first
    thought was get rid of the bit.
      Which you did, good job.
      Now you have to learn more about
    horses.   You say the horse fights
    you on a ride, a horse cannot fight alone,
    she fights because you fight.   A
    fight involved two, one cannot do it alone.
      So you need to stop fighting with
    her.   You said you let her run and
    she did not calm down, of course not, when
    you run a horse it sends them into flight
    mode and their body dumps endorphins into to
    them so they can run fast and not get eaten.
      Running a horse never calms a
    horse and anyone that says it does, does not
    know horses.<br>
    <br>
    Every horse is different and every horse
    teaches you, this horse is teaching you to
    improve your horsewomanship.   You
    need to work on your self and you need to
    improve and your horse will improve.
      I am not riding with you so I can
    only guess, but when you say fight I can
    picture you as pulling on the reins, always
    holding her back, and using the reins for
    security since you think if you let go she
    will run off.<br>
    <br>
    I would suggest you ride this horse with a
    halter and lead rope in a round pen or small
    area.   Learn to use one rein to
    control her and gain trust and confidence.
      As you do this you will learn
    that you don't need to pull on two reins to
    control her and you will have to develop
    softer hands.   Soft hands make
    soft horses.   If you ride her with
    one rein you will gain confidence in yourself
    and the horse will know this and will respond
    to you better and you both will grow and have
    better rides.</p>

    <p>This horse is 5 so he is fully grown and I
    agree he probably has baggage you are not
    aware of.   However, the slow way
    is the fast way.   Make sure you
    training sessions are no longer than 20 or 30
    mins.   It is better to train 3
    times a day for 20 mins than try and 2 hours
    in one setting.   Horses learn from
    release, too many people try and start new
    horses and then want to go and go and keep
    going just because it is going good, Stopping
    is so importing, too many times people don't
    know when to stop, keep going until the horse
    gets fed up and then blows and then they
    stop, bad timing and bad training.
      <br>
    <br>
    Getting off with the tail swish and belly
    kick is not good, you don't the horse to
    learn that by doing this you get off, then he
    will do it more and worse.   Ignore
    his attempts to scare you or push you, push
    back so he forgets what he did and then stop
    after you get him to do something you ask for
    and something he is good at and something
    that you know he knows well, that way you set
    him up for success.   It is easy to
    make a horse fail, that is the old rough guy
    training, Natural horsemen set the horse up
    to pass and do succeed, you do this by making
    things clear, showing the horse there is only
    ONE right answer and then giving release the
    sec he tries the right answer.<br>
    <br>
    Do lots of sacking, read my horsemanship
    page, it is long but you will understand
    horses better after you read it.</p>

    <hr>
    Q: I am in Australia and would be happy for
    you to post my question on your site with
    your nice kind answer!

    <p>I have just been offered an ex-racehorse
    which I'm thinking of taking on as he is a
    nice big horse (I am tall) and strong,
    intelligent and hasn't been messed around as
    far as handling goes - he is easy to touch
    over his head, bridle, saddle, handle
    etc.</p>

    <p><br>
    Doc is nearly 9, He has been racing most of
    his life until recently so this could be a
    handful, and not sure if I am taking on too
    much of a challenge, but I am very open to
    working the "right" way with him to have him
    be the gentle and happy hack that I'm hoping
    for!<br>
    <br>
    I read your piece on bosal vs snaffle and
    would love to give this a go if this is the
    best way to communicate without pain. I do
    want to eventually do dressage comps if I
    choose to so not sure if they allow
    hackamores but great if they do!<br>
    <br>
    So far I first got on him to see how he felt
    and he went nicely at a walk in a snaffle bit
    and felt quite soft and I have soft hands. We
    then did a little bit of trotting and all
    went well. He seemed to round up but does not
    really have the concept of straight lines yet
    being a racehorse only knowing a white fence
    on one side at 60km an hour!<br>
      <br>
    The next time I got on him was a dumb move as
    I should really be doing lots of ground
    training first) he was lovely at the walk and
    understandably still not responding to left
    or right very well (rein held out in the
    direction and other on the neck, eyes in the
    direction, legs gently aiding - but when I
    asked him to trot he lost the plot and took
    off like a racehorse would and so I decided
    in order to preserve my life, that I better
    just do some ground training now and not be
    so silly as to think I can get on a racehorse
    and do what all the other horses I've been
    riding do. Today I put a halter on and a
    lunge rein and am starting to get him used to
    going around me in circles at a good walk,
    stopping to my voice, calmly turning the
    other way. Standing him still and turning his
    neck towards me while pushing him away from
    the gut area. He is so happy to respond and
    likes being told what to do - always looking
    for his boundaries and the next instruction.
    He did take off when a stable mate ran past,
    but I don't have the luxury of a coral to
    hold him in right now. So went and got him
    and started again. I just don't want him to
    be taking off and thinking this is the best
    way to gain "release".<br>
      <br>
       My issue is I don't have a lot
    of ground training experience in re-training
    horses. Apart from working with a very quiet
    warmblood for the last 2 years who is so
    quiet I got on him after 6 months of ground
    training and have been quietly and happily
    riding him since. I'm not sure whether to
    apply the same training to an ex-racehorse?
    What would you suggest in terms of starting
    him in a bosal and which is the best type?
    Can I use bosal and dressage saddle?! If you
    have a section on re-training ex-racehorses I
    would love to see it so you don't have to
    type too much - any suggested readings or
    DVD's I'd love to see too. Do you want to see
    a photo -<br>
    <br></p>

    <p>Thanks for your time Rick</p>

    <p>A: You ask for a nice kind answer like I
    would give anything else........... :) You
    came to the wrong guy for that.   I
    happen to think I give good advice to help
    the horse, if a human gets better because of
    it, so be it, but my goal is too to help the
    horse.   So if people just listen
    and try and understand the horse and not
    concentrate on ME or how I said something or
    how I was not nice or how I was a hardass,
    they would see my advice as the way a horse
    see's them, confused and frustrated with the
    human lack of understanding of the
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    So enough jigger jabber about us foolish
    humans.   This horse is just a
    horse, it does not matter if it is abused, a
    ex racehorse, an Olympic winner or a wild
    mustang (brumby), all horses are the same in
    their behavior, instincts and
    communication.   When I work with a
    horse I treat it like a horse and depending
    on how he responds or reacts then I adjust
    what I do, but I always treat him like a
    horse in horse language.<br>
    <br>
    Basically pressure and release, I am higher
    and I do not move away, I control their feet,
    change their direction, make them back up,
    make them stop and make them move, all of
    this tells them I am the higher horse, I am
    the lead horse, I can push them and they
    cannot push me, I can put pressure and I can
    remove pressure, I can keep pressure on and
    they cannot get release until they give me
    the right answer or ask me for
    release.   Your
    mistake:   So when you ask for a
    trot and the horse runs off on his own, he
    tells you and you tell him, you cannot
    control him, you cannot stop him and you are
    not the high horse and he should not listen
    to you.   So when you lunge a
    horse and he gets away, you tell him you
    cannot control him, you can't stop him, you
    are a weak leader, he can get release
    himself, he is smarter and you are not a good
    leader and he should not listen or trust
    you.  <br>
    <br>
    So every time you TRY and fail, you teach the
    horse bad lessons, you make the horse smarter
    and you lose your position, this makes all
    future training harder on the horse, since it
    is their nature to test their leaders and try
    and move up higher and they have to test
    their leader all the time to ensure only the
    strongest and smartest is in
    charge.   Every time they test and
    you correct correctly, give good direction
    and prevent them from pushing you, getting
    away, or something else, you move up and
    maintain your high position and all training
    will be easier.<br>
    <br>
    So when I say set a horse up to succeed that
    means you don't fail or the horse fails. When
    you mess up the horse pays, when you do not
    plan and the horse wins, you fail and the
    horse pays.   If you go slow and
    take the time it takes, it will take less
    time.   Short cuts don't work and
    they cheat the horse and you and fail most of
    the time.<br>
    <br>
    You got in a hurry and tried to do too much
    too fast, you set the horse to fail by TRYING
    and guessing what would happen or guessed
    that it MIGHT work out, so you wanted to see
    what would happen if you tried to trot, the
    horse was not ready, you were not ready, the
    horse ran off, he lost confidence in you, he
    knows you are not a good leader, he does not
    trust you now and is less likely to do what
    you tell him.   You set him up to
    fail and he did, now he has to
    pay.   You have to get tougher, you
    have regain that position you loss and you
    have to push harder, he will push harder back
    since you have proven that he cannot trust
    you to be in control, he will try and take
    control since he thinks he has too, since you
    told him and showed him that you are not a
    strong leader.   This cycle causes
    confusion and tears down trust and respect
    all because of you. You did not plan, you did
    not start small and ensure success, you did
    not prepare the horse properly so it knew
    what you wanted, so it knew how to give you
    the right answer, you did not know the horse,
    you did not spend enough time with horse, you
    did not ensure you position as leader or high
    horse and now the horse has to
    pay.  <br>
    <br>
    When I say pay, I mean you have to be
    tougher, harder and more strict, you undo
    what YOU did and the have to push the horse
    harder so he will not want to test you, so he
    will start to think you are a good leader, so
    he can trust you and he does not have to test
    you since you show him, you are in change,
    you will keep him safe, you will give him
    good direction so he knows the right answer
    and can find the right answer easy.<br>
    <br>
    So, you made some mistakes that did not have
    to be made. If you learn from them and grow
    -- good, if you blame the horse of look for
    excuses or try and make this a horse or ex
    racehorse issue, then you will continue to
    make the horse pay for your lack of
    understanding of the horse.  <br>
    <br>
    This horse needs what every horse needs, a
    good strong, fair leader that understand how
    to be a horse and what it is to be a horse,
    then trust and a relationship will
    grow.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site from start to finish, just a
    little each day, read it as if a horse is
    saying what I say, go the links and articles
    and read and study the way of the horse, the
    more you think like a horse and understand
    them, the easier it will be for you and the
    horse.<br>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hello, I am 24
    years old. I have the horse who is 12 years
    old, gelding. He lives in a pasture with
    other horses. In the herd there are about 25
    horses. The first in the hierarchy - the
    leader is one mare, and my horse is the
    second one. So usually he behave with other
    horses quite angry, usually shows his
    leadership. I take him to the stables just
    once per week in order to brush him, ride and
    to spend my leisure time with him just being
    around him. Usually with me he is very
    friendly and curious in the stable. The
    problem is that I don €˜t
    like his behavior then I ask him to go
    forward. And it €˜s not
    important if I am on the ground or in the
    saddle, he starts to go forward hard. Then I
    am on the ground and I ask him to go forward,
    or follow me I have to pull him with the rope
    and tell him with word
     €žcommon,
    common €œ, or touch his side
    in order to move him. And then I am on the
    saddle it is the same, I have to force him to
    go forward. I would like to know how can I do
    something to make him go forward more quickly
    without forcing him too much. I
    don €˜t understand why he
    doesn't want to listen to me then going
    forward? Because then I am on the ground I
    can ask him by the word or with my hand to go
    backward and he does it. Also I can ask him
    to move right or left, I can ask him to raise
    his hoof and he responds me quit quickly with
    a wish to do it. And in the saddle after with
    effort to go forward I can trot, counter,
    walk again, stand still. So the problem is
    starting to go forward.<br>
    I hope to get your answer.<br>
    Best wishes from Lithuania!<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> If he does all these
    others things good, then this may be a
    confusion issue.   When I say
    confusion, it is on different levels for this
    horse.   He is used to being high
    horse and only answers to one higher horse 90
    percent of the time.   So when you
    come around once a week and expect him to
    listen and respect you (in his mind you push
    him around and make him work), so he thinks
    why should I let this person that I only see
    once a week come out here and push me around.
      Remember he gets to push around
    23 other horses everyday and every hour he
    wants, you have to make it clear and show him
    that it is to his benefit to listen you or he
    gets to work more.<br>
    <br>
    IF you are asking a horse two and three times
    to do something then you have taught him that
    he does not have to listen on the first ask.
      The reason he moves back and side
    ways is you are pushing him in those
    directions, you need to push him forward.
      lunge him and make sure you are
    behind the driveline. (I discuss this on my
    horsemanship page of my site) You said you
    are pulling and saying come on, you can't
    pull a horse, you are only teaching him that
    he is stronger than you, not a good lesson,
    you need to move his feet, if he does not
    walk when you say walk, you need to turn up
    the pressure, make him move backwards, make
    him run backwards, make him change
    directions, make him move his feet, this will
    tell him you are the boss, you are in
    control, you can move him feet, and he will
    figure out, if you do it right, the horse
    will know it.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Hi, I am a 51
    year old woman who grew up with horses;
    always loved to ride... been away from it far
    too long..finally re-entering the world of
    horses..Got a 2 year old gelding 1 year
    ago... He's 3 now. Much, much
      trail riding,
        expose him to
    noises,barking dogs that run out and
    chase,always try to manage him through his
    fears and being nervous... but I can't seem
    to get him to get better about the cars or
    trucks that we always encounter while riding
    the roads... they slow down, even stop when
    they see him acting up. I steady myself and
    hold him in and talk him through each
    situation   ..Say " EASY"
        repeat it Can you
    help me come up with a better
    technique?    </p>

    <p>   <strong>Answer:</strong>
    Since I believe that most horse problems are
    caused by people, I normally go there first.
      You say you hold him in when he
    acts up, I would think that holding him is
    making him act up.   You think he
    will react, you think it, feel it and try to
    prevent it and then it causes it.
      A lot of people who get back into
    horses later in life, have a lot more fear of
    getting hurt, they are a lot more careful and
    fearful, the horse knows this.
      Riders that are scared tend to
    hold on the reins tight and are always trying
    to hold a horse back.   This
    creates frustration and confusion in the
    horse.   The is looking for release
    and the right answer, since he can't figure
    out the right answer and feels all this
    pressure all the time, he continues to look
    for the right answer, so he get more anxious
    and nervous, he feels less secure and it
    tears down the relationship with the
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    You say you try and manage through his fears
    and nervousness, I think you are trying to
    manage your fears and nervousness.
      A horse is a reflection of the
    person handling him, a confident person
    normally has a confident horse, a nervous
    person has a nervous horse, a scared person
    has a scared horse.   Work on
    yourself and your horse will get better.
      Stop trying to make this a horse
    problem and stop trying to save the horse,
    help the horse, protect, manage the horse or
    hold him in.   <br>
    <br>
    Do more sacking out, I discuss this in detail
    on my horsemanship page of my site.
      This will help you read him
    better, and help him deal with any fear.</p>

    Question: I adopted a prison trained mustang
    last August. I would like to teach him to
    work in a harness, dragging large logs,
    pulling a cart,  ect. At the
    auction,  I saw the trainer using
    the horse to  drag a small log on a
    rope. When I tried something similar he shot
    off like a bat all over the pasture like a
    dork. When he finally calmed down, I lead him
    into the  round pen  and
    slowly re-introduced him to the concept,
    maybe I should have done this first? The
    horse seemed to be uncomfortable with
    dragging anything at all, just a rope. Maybe
    it's just an excuse, to see what he might
    possibly get away with.  Another
    issue we have while working in the arena, he
    tries to reject pole work.  Any
    suggestions?

    <p>  </p>

    <p>A: If you get the wrong answer, YOU asked
    the question wrong. Not to be rude, but would
    think dork would more likely apply to a
    person that scared the crap out of their
    horse without properly preparing them for
    success.   You are lucky he just
    ran, had he really got scared he may run
    through a fence, tried to jump a fence and
    killed or hurt himself badly.  
    Like always, horses always have to pay for
    peoples mistakes.   As you rightly
    pointed out, you should have done the round
    pen and slowly introduced it to the
    horse.   Lets look at this like a
    person who knows nothing about
    horses.   If I saw a horse do
    something good with one person and then
    another person tried the same thing and it
    was a mess €¦..if the horse
    is the same horse, the only thing that
    changed was the person €¦
    most would see this as the person did
    something wrong and caused the mess and
    conversely the other person caused the good
    outcome.   For some reason horse
    people never see things this way.  
    A horse is reflection of the person handling
    it, it turns out good, the person did the
    right things, if it turns out bad, the person
    did the wrong things.   Hence the
    saying:   Most horse problems are
    really people problems.   Your
    question put most fault on the horse, you use
    words like  €œhe rejects pole
    work €, that is what you
    say.   I say you have not present
    pole work properly, you have not helped him
    accept pole work, you are teaching resistance
    and the horse is learning.   You
    say the horse shot off like a dork, I say you
    scared the carp out of him, did not think
    like a horse and set the horse up for
    failure.   I know you did not
    intend to do this, but results is all that
    matter, intentions are just something
    discussed later to make people feel better,
    horses have no concept of our
    intentions.   Another way to look
    at this is, before you got involved and put
    the rope on the horse was he running around
    like a dork? No.   So the sooner
    people look at all actions from a horse is a
    result of what they do, then they can begin
    to change what they do so the horse will
    change.   Too often, people do the
    same thing and expect different results from
    a horse.   Cut this horse some
    slack, he has been captured, ripped from his
    herd, trained by a stranger and caged, then
    moved again, now is with a new owner, new
    environment and is getting scared to death by
    his new owner trying to do too much, too fast
    and without proper preparation.  
    If you can admit, which I think you got by
    your questions, that this horse did nothing
    wrong and is not a bad horse and that every
    action the horse did was caused by you, then
    you learn from this, not repeat it and not
    set this poor
     €œdorky € horse
    up for another bad lesson.   Since
    you had the knowledge to bring him to the
    round pen, you know what you should have
    done, just do it in the future.  
    The slow way is the fast way with
    horses.  </p>

    <p>Well every time I hear "Amish" I cringe.
      These people are in the dark
    ages, literally.   They still use
    crude and cruel methods to train horses.
      First of all the picture appears
    that the draft horse is very under weight.
      She looks at least 3 or 400
    pounds under weight from the picture so make
    sure she is getting lots of good hay whenever
    she wants.   You have look at this
    horse as if it has been abused and neglected.
      You have to teach this horse that
    it can trust people and not see people as
    just a mean thing that hurts him.
      I would stop riding him for a
    while, put some weight on him, bond with him
    and just spend time grooming him, doing light
    and easy ground work.   Get him to
    see you as his leader and as his partner and
    friend.   I would not believe
    anything you were told about this horse.
      Maybe it is just the picture, but
    the horse does not look comfortable with your
    child standing next to him.   The
    horse looks very dull and almost
    unemotional.<br>
    <br>
    Hard to tell from one still pic so I could be
    way off, but you are there, be careful you
    have no idea what this horse has experienced
    so prove everything to yourself.
      As for hiring a trainer, don't
    send your horse to a trainer, you get
    training, you watch every lesson or training
    session, that way you see how the horse
    responds, how he reacts to fear, what to do
    and not to do.   Never send a horse
    to training, get yourself trained and then
    you can train and apply things to your
    horse.<br>
    <br>
    Read my site so you will have a better
    understanding of horses, how they think and
    live.   It will help you with your
    relationship with this horse.</p>

    Lots of time a baby will pick up the behavior
    of the mom.   So the baby may warm
    up after it sees mom getting attention.
      The first thing I tell people to
    do when they say I can't catch my horse, is,
    Stop trying to catch them.   A
    horse knows, you have to stop trying so they
    will stop trying to run and prevent you from
    catching them.   So don't try and
    catch her, ignore her, let her get curious,
    let her wonder why you are not going after
    her, she will come to you to investigate and
    check you out, if you don't get all huggy and
    grabby and try and reach out to pet her or
    put pressure on her, she will rub on you and
    nuzzle you, but if you are trying to touch
    her (putting pressure) then she will keep
    trying to move away and avoid it.
      Carrots are good teachers, once
    you get her to eat a few and like them then
    you can use them to get her to want to come
    to you and want to get more.

    <p>  I have to disagree with never
    buy a horse out of sympathy, it depends what
    you are buying for. If you understand a horse
    you can help a horse greatly by being a
    strong and fair leader so he will not be
    dangerous and you can make him a better and
    safer horse.   Abused or neglected
    horses need homes that understand them and
    can help them.   The problem is
    some people think they are helping them by
    being nice and feeding them, that is just as
    bad as being mean to them.   The
    best gift you can give to a horse is
    knowledge about the horse.   Glad
    you checked out my page, my way is not the
    only way, but it seems to work for me and
    many others.   <br>
    <br>
    Try not to look at this horse as a mistake,
    look at him as a learning experience, he is
    going to teach you more about a horse than
    your other horse every could.   He
    is going to make you become a better
    horseperson and he is teach you more about
    horses than any person ever could.
      So embrace this as you are a
    student of this the horse and this horse is
    doing you a favor by teaching you.
      At the end you will look back and
    see that you are better because of this
    horse, you will know more and you will
    appreciate the final result more.

    <p>QUESTION: Iam 63 years old.I have always
    loved horses. I have a 8 year old haflinger
    that I have had for 6 years. He was trained
    to drive and my daughter and I drive him
    around the farm occasionally. My daughter
    wants to have her wedding on the farm and
    drive in the pony cart,in May of 2010. I
    think the excitement of that setting would
    set him off,but I don't want to disappoint.
    When I say we drive him occasionally it is
    because I don't fully trust him. One telling
    thing he does is that when he is loose and
    you let him through a pasture gate he will
    aim a kick in my direction. He can be
    rude.<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: Well I would rather disappoint your
    daughter then get her hurt or killed on her
    wedding day. If you try and rush this horse
    or make it do something it is not ready for
    and you are not ready for you setting the
    horse and everyone else up for failure.
      If it is that important get
    someone who does this for a living and has
    had lots of previous success with this.
      A wedding is a very high sensory
    type environment.   I would compare
    it to a parade, riot, concert or other loud
    situation.   This puts a lot of
    pressure on the horse, the horse needs
    preparation, good past experiences, good
    confidence in it's leader and needs to be
    introduced in small steps to insure
    success.<br>
    <br>
    This is not the case, you don't have the time
    the horse needs and this is a disaster
    looking for a place to happen.<br>
    <br>
    With that said, I get very protective of
    horses that are called names. I know that
    horses are only reflections of their handling
    so when someone calls a horse a name they are
    describing them self.   From this
    horses perspective, he thinks you are rude.
      You don't work with him everyday,
    you ignore him most of the time, you trained
    him to drive and then did not continue it, so
    he may feel abandoned, you said you trust
    him, why should he trust you, a horse will
    not accept a leader that does not trust them.
      He kicks when you let him out
    since YOU allow it, YOU do not prevent it,
    YOU do not teach him that it is unacceptable,
    YOU have spent the time to correct it, YOU
    have not given him good enough direction so
    he knows not to do it, YOU are not confident
    when you handle him, YOU............
      :)   get the message,
    all horse problems are people problems, if
    you improve yourself, your horse gets better,
    if you blame the horse and call him names,
    you keep doing the same thing, so your horse
    keeps doing the same thing..........
      if you want change from your
    horse YOU have change first.<br>
    <br>
    I bet you a plane ticket and expenses that I
    can turn this horse out and he will kick at
    me. :) When I show people this, they still
    don't want to admit they are problem.
      When a acts differently when I
    handle them, people will say, I have a gift,
    the horse likes me, I have a special bla bla
    bla,   NO, it is none of that, I
    understand horses, I know how to talk to
    horses, I communicate with horses, I give
    them good direction and they respond.
      But if people admit this...
      that would mean they are the
    problem.... most horse owner in the world
    will tell you if a horse is bad, it is the
    horse's fault???<br>
    <br>
    I believe it is never the horse's
    fault.<br>

    QUESTION: You are right. I would like to find
    this horse a new home but don't want to
    endanger anyone else. Do you have any
    suggestions for me,for the sake of this
    horse's future? Valerie<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: This horse is not mean, so don't call
    it that when you try and sell it. It needs
    time and attention, it needs good consistent
    handling and it will only test other people
    if they let it, if they correct it he will
    learn how to be nice.   I would
    look around and see if someone has a lone
    horse and if someone is looking for a pasture
    mate for their horse.   Another
    horse, especially an older mare will teach
    this horse some manners and respect
    lessons.<br>
    <br>
    So I would approach it as this horse needs a
    owner that is willing to send lot so time and
    has some experience with horses or as this
    horse needs a nice pasture and herd to hang
    out with so it can be a horse.

    QUESTION: ok,thank you for the answer. My
    options now are to donate the horse to a
    charity that does work with teenagers or to
    take him to a haflinger auction. Just for
    information how do I keep him from exploding
    and kicking in my direction today like he did
    yesterday?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If he respects
    you he will not kick at you, you can pull his
    head to his butt which makes his butt go away
    from you, as long as he head faces you, who
    cares if he kicks, but this is not a kicking
    issue, it is a respect issue.   He
    thinks you are lower so he kicks at you, once
    you show him you can make him back up, you
    can take his head away, you can disengage his
    hips, you can make him uncomfortable and put
    pressure on him, then he will start thinking
    you are higher and he will not kick.<br>
    <br>
    You have to approach this from a horse's view
    and the way horses think and live, not from a
    owner or human view.</p>

    <p>  QUESTION: I have got a 3 yr
    old new forest filly no one wanted her she is
    untouched i have put her in a big stable she
    is comming to me but i am leaving her needy
    she lets me touch her face when she's eating,
    i'm not crowding her she's following me and
    i'm not invaiding her space. she's only been
    in for one week and really come on i just
    want to check whether i'm doing right
    building her trust i've put headcollar in
    feed and she's played with it i've hung it up
    so she's not scared i have raised foster
    foals but i had the trust from day one i just
    want to check if i'm doing right and get your
    advice as you know horse world is full of
    experts some telling me to tie her up and
    rope her down to get head collar, i feel
    every horse is different and i know it's
    about pressure i just would like your advice
    please, i'm 38 i was brought up with pit
    ponies from 3 yrs , worked as stable girl on
    race yard for 3 yrs in ireland, hunted and
    raised foster foals, now happy to hack round
    until she come along, she's a lovely filly
    just want to do right by her thanks<br>
    <br>
    ANSWER: It sounds like you are doing ok. I
    would just be aware that you have see things
    as the horse sees them. Horse only respect
    higher horses, so you make sure the horse
    does not see you as weak when you say you are
    no invading her space, she may see this as
    she is pushing you away and not letting you
    into her space, big difference.
      Time is the best thing with a
    horse, but if that time is teaching the horse
    that it is higher,it is in charge, it is
    stronger, or smarter than you will be working
    against yourself.   It does not
    matter what we think we are doing, what
    matters is what does the horse think... this
    is key.   A has to know it can
    trust you, but it also has to know that you
    are higher, you are in charge, you can move
    them, you are the higher horse.
      Too many people try and be too
    nice and kind and never push or challenge a
    horse and then the horse takes advantage,
    starts getting pushy, kicks, bites and other
    behavior, that is normal for horses, and that
    is what they do to lower horses.
      Then people want to say their
    horse is mean or aggressive.   When
    in fact, they caused this behavior by not
    understanding horses and not being a higher
    horse.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> I am 27 years
    old and am an intermediate rider. I have a 9
    and 7 year old Tennessee Walking Horse. When
    I got them they were very calm and would ride
    very well.   I have had their shoes
    taken off and now have a natural horse
    practioner that trims their hooves every
    three weeks if needed.   The horses
    are kept out 98% of the time and they are not
    with any horses.   They are only in
    the stalls during bad weather.
      The horses diet has not changed
    and they are being ridden often.
      However, my problem now is that
    both horses want to run the entire time you
    are on them.   They will not stop
    and will not slow down no matter what bit is
    used.   Yesterday we rode a seven
    hour ride on open trails and they ran the
    entire time.   You could not hold
    the horses back.   They did not
    break a sweat or anything.   I do
    not mind going fast, but only if I want them
    too.   I also cannot stop them.
      I really have no clue what to
    do.<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> First
    you need to realize that bits do not stop or
    control horses, they cause pain and fear and
    make the horse nervous. Most all problems are
    people caused.   If you cannot stop
    or control a horse you have no business
    taking them out in open trials, you are a
    danger to yourself, others and the horse.
      Put this horse in an enclosed
    area, an arena or round pen, smaller the
    better.   A horse will get bored
    before it gets tired.   Teach this
    horse to stop, walk, trot and canter on
    command while you are on the ground, this
    will ensure that the horse knows.
      Then try and repeat this when in
    the saddle in the same small area, this will
    be familiar so you will be setting up the
    horse for success and not to fail (like you
    are doing now/failing)<br>
    <br>
    If you take the time it takes, it takes less
    time.   The slow way is the fast
    way for horses. Read my website so you can
    understand horses better.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> hi i have a
    nearly 5yr old welsh pony gelding.he used to
    get along with other horses or pony but now
    we cant put him in with any other
    ponies(mares or gelding) or horses that are
    geldings.he only gets along with mare
    horses.anytime a horse or pony comes near him
    he will turn round and go to buck or kick
    him.we have tried to put him with our welsh
    pony mare whos smaller but he just fights
    with her too it makes it difficult as we
    agist so i now have had to more him to a
    place where he is alone.he was fine before
    what could have changed his attitude.he went
    on a 4week training with someone to educate
    him more and since then hes not the same.do
    you think it could have possibly been from a
    horse who may have kicked him and no he wants
    to get them first any others before they get
    him.he is in a paddock with just grass thats
    long and dry where i agist.please help he is
    a loving pony<br>
       <strong>Answer:</strong> All
    horses fight,buck and kick, this is normal
    horse behavior. All horse appear not to get a
    long at first, but this is normal. People
    tend to try and protect them and help them
    and keep moving them out to save them.
      Put him in with the horses and
    let them work it out, as long at the other
    horses have a place to run they will learn
    who is boss, who is leader and who is in
    charge.   <br>
    <br>
    Bad horses are not born, they are made.....
    This pony is just trying to prove himself as
    a strong leader and demanding respect from
    the other horses.<br>
    <br>
    As soon as the other horses submit to him the
    fighting will stop, most people pull a horse
    out and separate them before this can be
    worked out, so it continues and the people
    make it worse.   Let the horses be
    horses, work out their issues without human
    interference and the fighting will stop in a
    week or so.<br>
    <br>
    Normally food makes horses fight, so make
    sure and feed in many piles so all horses
    have a place to go if they get pushed off
    their food, that way fights will be less.</p>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">  </td>

            <td valign="top">The horse is
            confused and scared. You need to set
            him up for success and slow down and
            make this easy steps. Don't load him
            all the way. Load his front feet and
            have him back out a few times, then
            if he is calm and has got the idea,
            load his front feet and one back leg
            only and then back him out.
              Then after a few times of
            that, then load all for legs (Not all
            the way in) and back him out.
              This horse needs to learn
            to back out blindly which is hard and
            scary.   You have really
            done this horse a disservice by
            setting him up for failure by letting
            him hit his head.   Now you
            have to undo what you have done and
            it will take three times as long.
              You never bring a horse
            into a place without teaching him how
            and that he can get out safely.
              You have taught this
            horse that when he loads for you and
            trust you, he gets his head hit so
            now he thinks you are setting him up
            and does not trust you.
              For good reason.
              You say this horse if
            strong willed,   I say you
            are not a strong leader for this
            horse so he feels he has to be strong
            willed to stay safe.   It
            is never the horses fault.<br>
            <br>
            All horses are leaders and all are
            followers, all horse kick and all
            horses get kicked, all horses bite
            and all get bitten, it what horses
            do. So if a horse feels he needs to
            be a leader to stay safe, he will and
            then people will blame the horse for
            being stubborn.<br>
            <br>
            You made many errors and your horse
            had to pay for your mistakes. It
            seems you thinking like a person and
            not like a horse of you would not
            have done this.<br>
            <br>
            Read my web site so you will
            understand horses better and start to
            think like they do, then when you
            train them, you train from their view
            point and not yours (human)</td>

      <hr>

      <p>ANSWER: Every time you allowed him to
      run out in fear, you teach him that you are
      not the leader and that you are not in
      control and he should not trust you. It
      does not matter what caused this, the fix
      is the same, you have to have him trust
      you, you have to have him see you as his
      leader, and you have to build his
      confidence so he will not want to
      run.<br>
      <br>
      Bring him in the trailer and let him turn
      around and walk out calmly. Don't try and
      shut the door, load him and walk him out
      several times safely and calmly. Let him
      know that he can go in and not get trapped
      and shut and locked in, after doing this
      for few days, then open and close the gate
      while his if outside the trailer so he gets
      used to it going up and down and all the
      movement and noise.   Then load
      him again and let him walk out.
        After he is really calm and
      listens to you well, THEN load him and move
      the door only an inch, and set it down and
      walk him out, then load him and pick the
      door up two inches and set it down and let
      him walk out, slowly get to where you can
      close it and then open it and walk him out,
      this is an easy fix, but most people want
      to do it fast and then it makes it worse
      and takes longer.   The slow way
      is the fast way with horses.<br>
      <br>
      As for your comment that he is used to
      being alone. You are wrong. No horse is
      happy alone, they need a herd or a buddy
      and they are miserable alone. They just
      accept it since they have no choice, so it
      may make you feel better thinking he likes
      it, I assure he he does not.
        This is a lot of the problem
      with his trust issues.   If you
      locked me up alone and kept me away from
      others, I would not trust you either.</p>

      <p>You have to one make sure you untie him
      so he will not get confused and scared. Now
      you have to start over and show him how to
      back out of a trailer slowly and
      controlled.   So don't let him
      load all the way.   Load just his
      front feet and back him out slowly.
        Do this a few times so he
      builds his confidence on back out slowly,
      then load only his front and maybe just one
      back foot, then back him out slowly, after
      few times of this, load him all the way and
      back him out slow (Don't tie him), after a
      few times of this he should learn that he
      can back out slowly and will not be trapped
      because someone forgot to untie him.</p>

      <p>Well I would agree that all horses hate
      trailers even if they go in and are good.
      All horses dislike them, they fear them,
      they are trapped, they cannot move, the
      sounds are loud, they have to pee and poop
      on themselves, they can't see anything, why
      would any horse like this.</p>
      <hr>

      <p><br>
      If trailering is not needed sure it would
      be better for no horse to ever be
      trailered. But if the desensitizing is done
      right a horse can be made to accept the
      trailer and reduce the nervousness.
        Read my sacking out section and
      my trailer loading page of my web site.
        The sacking out is on my
      horsemanship page.   This will
      give you some ideas on how to see if you
      can get this horse to trust you and not be
      so scared.</p>I can only give you advice,
      unless you are in CA close to Sacramento
      and I could come see the horse. This horse
      just needs good desensitizing on her feet.
      You can get a soft stick or short whip or
      cane or anything to use as an extension of
      your hand.   Rub and touch her
      feet and back legs all the time, only stop
      rubbing when she ignores it.
        Then give her break and go back
      and touch them again rub them and move
      things around her feet, after she gets good
      with that, tie a rope or sting to the end
      and rub them some more, then toss a rope
      about her back feet and let her get scared
      and throw it some more, keep throwing it
      around her feet and until she ignores it,
      then move to your hands, rub your hand down
      and move away, Don't pick up her back feet,
      just rub them and let her get used to you
      handling them and toughing them, then
      slowly start picking them up just an inch
      and only for a second.   Then put
      them down.   You have to put them
      down before she reacts and pulls them, so
      you have to be fast on the release.
        Then work from there after she
      is good with you picking them up and
      putting them down for one sec then go for
      two, then for three seconds, it will take
      time.   The problem is too many
      people want to hold the feet until the
      horse reacts and then they try to hold or
      let go and the horse leans that it needs to
      react to get release (foot down)
        so don't do that.<br>
      <br>
      This can be fixed in about an hour or two
      if done right. If you get in a hurry or try
      to rush it or get it done in an hour, it
      will not work. The horse has to learn that
      standing still and letting you touch her
      feet is the right answer, not moving,
      kicking and running away.   Since
      she has got release by moving and kicking
      she has been taught this and it is not her
      fault.   Forget on why she is
      this way and stay focused on the the right
      way.

              <p>No horse is every trained

              "trainer" he or she is pathetic and
              is not much of a trainer.
                Any trainer that calls
              a young horse stubborn is a fool
              and does not know horses.
                This horse had some bad
              experiences and she needs time,
              patience and understanding to help
              her, she does not need someone who
              thinks they are a trainer and then

              I discuss trailer loading in detail

              know.<br>
              <br>
              Basically you need to move the
              horses feet, make her know that she
              either loads or has to keep moving
              or working. You can force her and

      <p>This horse may have been beat or tied
      with chains before so he has a real fear so
      you need to help him with that. Sacking out
      will him with that and will build trust,
      that is on my horsemanship
      page.   This horse needs to learn
      the trailer is not a bad place.  
      Have the person he trust most to get in
      with him.   Pet, brush him, give
      him treats and DON:T close the
      door.   Tie the door open and
      only do good things in the trailer with him
      and let him learn he can learn any time he
      wants, over time he will like it and forget
      it is a scary place.   Then after
      a couple of weeks of training everyday with
      door open, then close the door for 5
      seconds and then open it, let him relax and
      then close it for 10 seconds, open it, for
      the first few times make sure he is not
      alone and the owner is in with him, after a
      few days of this you should be able to
      leave door closed for 10 mins.  
      Then shut the door and go outside and give
      a treat, pet and stay with him on outside
      of trailer, after a few days of that, then
      maybe stay inside shut the door and have
      someone drive the trailer 10 feet, stop and
      let him out, keep doing everything in small
      steps, nice and slow and don't push too
      fast or try and get fast
      results.   The more time you
      take, the less time it will
      take.   I a couple of months, he
      will be fine and will have loaded and
      unloaded 100 times and will not see it as
      such a scary place and then work up from
      there.   Don't lock him and take
      him on a 3 hour trailer ride and then
      expect him to want to get in again.</p>

      and still the same please help<br>
         <strong>Answer:</strong> You
      are teaching very bad lessons. Every time
      you TRY and load this horse and fail, you
      teach the horse he can get out, you cannot
      control him, you are not a good strong
      leader, and you tell the horse not to trust
      you since you put in in a situation where
      it needs to take action in it's own hands
      and save it self.   <br>
      <br>
      I have a trailer loading page on my site,
      read it and if you have more questions, let
      me know.</p>

      <p>QUESTION: Hi Rick,<br>
      <br>
      I need some fresh views and I like your
      frank and honest answers.   I
      agreed to help a lady load her horse, a 4
      yr old.   The mare has only been
      in a trailer twice in her life, nothing
      much has been done with her of quality.
        I entered up and now I have to
      finish what I started.<br>
      <br>
      I started out with basic ground work, hind
      quarters, front quarters, getting a bit
      going with having give to pressure, sending
      her forward off a feel, basics with my
      flag.   It was not great but I
      was getting some good changes.
        <br>
      <br>
      I loaded her front feet in the trailer, in
      and out several times until she felt pretty
      good and then asked for the hinds, rocking
      her in and out a couple of times and
      finally asking her to come all the way in.
        She did, but she didn't feel
      like she could stay for very long, so I
      backed her out before she did it on her
      own.   When I asked her for her
      fronts again, she braced and would not come
      forward. I put a feel on the halter,
      released for every try at coming forward,
      she would come forward to the back of the
      trailer and then just brace.   I
      tried increasing the pressure, using the
      tail end of my lead rope, my flag, a tarp
      and then some pretty good nips with the
      tail end of my lead.   She would
      kick when I nipped her with the lead, but
      brace completely with her head in the
      trailer.   I was still releasing
      for every try on her part.   When
      she would lock up, I would go back to my
      ground work, work more at getting her feet
      better, and then ask her to step back to
      the trailer where again she would lock up.
        I would tap her with the lead,
      releasing for the try, and then nip when I
      wasn't getting any effort at all.
        I couldn't get a change.
        I am missing something.
        I know my timing wasn't always
      perfect, but I have never had a horse just
      quit and not try especially when they get a
      nip from tail end of my lead rope.
        <br>
      <br>
      I owner had to leave and put the mare back
      in her pasture. I am so bothered about all
      of this.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks for what ever you have to offer,
      even if it is a swift kick in the
      butt.<br>
      <br>
      Anne<br>
      <br>
      ANSWER: Well it sounds like you were on the
      right track with some release, you lost me
      and the horse when you tired to force him
      in. You don't want to use fear and flight
      as a motivator, so using a flag and tarp to
      scare a horse into another scary place
      (trailer) is confusing and gives the horse
      reason to question you leadership abilities
      and to trust you.   <br>
      <br>
      Trailer loading is about trust and
      leadership, you failed so the horse failed.
      You tired to force and make the horse
      enter, you should have stuck to what you
      can make the horse do (forward movement),
      you have to make the horse WANT to enter
      the trailer, not force him into the
      trailer.   <br>
      <br>
      You are NOT thinking like a horse. I will
      be your horse, so this is your horse
      talking: "what the hell does this two
      legged predator want, first I go into the
      trailer and trust her and follow her and
      then she wants to try and scare me with
      this stupid flag and tarp to get trapped in
      this small box trap, where I can't see very
      well and I can't run from danger.
        If she is hitting me with rope
      out here, what the hell is she going to do
      if I go in this box.   Why does
      she want me in the box so bad? It can't be
      good if she is willing to hit me and sace
      me just to get me in there.   She
      must be crazy if she thinks I am going to
      get in this box because she is hitting me
      with a rope and trying to scare me.
        I am scared since she is acting
      like a mean aggressive predator, I don't
      trust her since she is scaring and hurting
      me, so the last thing I am going to do is
      get into this box trap where no telling
      what she is going to do to me. I better
      watch myself with this thing, she is not
      instilling confidence with me and I better
      not listen to her very much since she is
      not consistent bears watching."<br>
      <br>
      Your focus was on the trailer and winning.
      You forgot about the HORSE. You failed to
      accept small tries and give the horse the
      time it needed. You tried to force it too
      fast and the horse had to remind you that
      even with a rope, pain and fear, you are
      not stronger, you are not smarter, you
      can't force it and you did not win.
        So horse 1, you Zero.
        You got too fast and did not
      take the time you should have, so now you
      have to undo all the bad you taught and it
      will take you three times a long.
        Hence the saying: If you take
      the time it takes, it takes less
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Next time, forget the trailer, pay
      attention to the horse. Work the horse
      without fear, tarp, and flags, just work on
      movement. Have the horse move in the
      direction you want and at the speed you
      want and stop when you want.
        All of this will say you are
      leader and you are in control, after you do
      this in front of the trailer, on the sides
      of the trailer, and by the rear door of the
      trailer, the horse will forget about the
      trailer, as you should.   The
      only time the horse gets to stop and rest
      is at the entry door of the trailer, don't
      run the crap out of him, don't try and wear
      him down, just make him move and let him
      rest at the door.   Once he is
      really locked on to you then move him
      around and direct him into the trailer or
      towards the door, anytime he looks in the
      trailer, sniffs the trailer or attempts to
      put a hoof in or go in, YOU GO NEUTRAL, NO
      PRESSURE, NO LOOKS, NO TALKING, NO GOOD
      BOYS, NO NOTHING, make it very clear that
      you leave him alone and stop ALL pressure.
      If you do it right, let me say that again,
      "If you do it right", the horse will learn
      that the trailer is a safe place, the
      trailer gets him release of all pressure,
      the trailer is where he wants to be [make
      the right thing easy, wrong thing hard] the
      horse will see the trailer as comfort and
      no work or movement, the horse will WANT to
      be in trailer.   If you do it
      wrong, "THIS IS A CLUE", the horse will
      tell you, listen to the horse.
        <br>
      <br>
      There is a very big difference forcing and
      making a horse trailer load than making the
      horse WANT to trailer load. One is done by
      someone who does not understand horses, the
      other is done by the reverse.   I
      will let you decide in what category you
      belong.   :)<br>
      <br>
      As for all horsemanship, "The horse is
      never at fault and is never wrong, if you
      got the wrong answer, you asked the
      question wrong the wrong way." ALWAYS
      listen to the horse, it will tell you if
      you doing it right or doing it wrong.
        This horse was screaming that
      you are doing it wrong, you were just so
      focusing on what you wanted, you did not
      listen.<br>
      <br>
      A good question to ask is "if you were a
      horse, how would you like to be trailer
      loaded"?<br>
      <br>
      I have a page on my site about trailer
      loading.<br>

      I really needed to hear what you had to
      say. I have some dues to pay. I acted like
      a human and now I really owe the horse.
        This mare is teaching me a lot.

      ANSWER: Calm seas never made a good sailor.
      Easy horses never make a good
      horseman/horsewoman.<br>
      <br>
      As you long as you learn, don't blame the
      horse and listen to horse, they will
      continue to teach you.   Not a
      short journey, so enjoy the ride.
          This horse is
      making you better, is making you think more
      like a horse, is making you change.<br>
      <br>
      If you want your horse to change, you must
      first change.<br>
      <br>
      If you always do what you have always done;
      you will always get what you have always
      got...<br>
      <br>
      All good horse people have learned from
      many horses, made many mistakes and look
      back at how little we really knew, when we
      really thought we knew a lot.<br>
      <br>
      Don't beat yourself up too bad, just try
      and avoid the same mistakes.
        This horse will forgive you and
      will have no hard feelings, just don't make
      her do it too often.   :)<br>

      <p>  </p>

      <p>Question: i hope this isn't a redundant
      question, but i did not find it on your
      site.   <br>
      we were just given a 15 year old TW
      gelding.   a little spoiled, but
      responds well to correction.
        smart, well trained. loads very
      well.   <br>
      it's after he's in the trailer that's a
      problem.   the throws his chest
      at the trailer wall, and sits back to get
      his front feet up on the wall.
        he's had a couple of accidents
      in his last trailer, but mine is much
      bigger and a slant load.   i
      thought he might be more comfortable in it,
      but no dice.   first ride in it
      and he was throwing himself every time we
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      i can take some banging around, but i am
      afraid this could be dangerous if we are
      ever stuck in traffic, etc.<br>
      <br>
      my background is in cutting.   i
      have started and trained my own and done a
      fair amount of trailer training.
        i have never dealt with
      this.<br>
      <br>
      my plan was to do some loading and
      unloading so that he didn't feel like we
      had to hit the road every time the door was
      shut.   my hope was that i could
      start with really short loads and extend
      the time, unloading him when he was
      still...if he's ever still.
        also just some time standing
      tied to the hitching post, as part of his
      problem is lack of patience.<br>
      ideas?   advice?   i'd
      like to do this correctly from the
      start.<br>
      <br>
      thanks for your time.<br>
      <br>
      Answer:   ummm, this is
      different. I might try and use a stock
      trailer and drive him around in that so you
      can have someone follow and may video tape
      what he is doing when and why. Also a more
      roomy stock trailer with no panels and lots
      of room may not give him the comfort or
      leverage to do this and if he does do it,
      so what let him get out of what he gets in
      to, more room will lessen the chance of him
      getting hurt.<br>
      <br>
      Tie time sounds like that may be an issue.
      I would also hobble train and teach the
      horse to accept being restrained, by
      hobbles and by being tied. Do some sacking
      out when hobbles are on and tied, again
      teach him to accept stress and pressure
      when restrained so you help him deal with
      his fear better.   This may not
      be caused by fear and could be spoiled or
      he has never been taught not to do
      it.<br>
      <br>
      I would also take out panels of trailer and
      after he ties good, tie him in trailer with
      door open and no panels, teach him to tie
      in trailer.   Exposure always
      helps so the horse learns what to expect
      and leans that he can not change what
      happens.<br>
      <br>
      I would also have someone watch this horse
      in the trailer that he does this in, as you
      drive slow and that person can see what is
      going on, maybe put a video camera in
      trailer so you can see what he does before
      he does what he does and then a tap on the
      brakes or something to distract him from
      doing what is about to do.
        Without knowing you can't time
      it correctly so hard to teach him to
      stop.<br>
      <br>
      Not sure if this helps, but sounds like you
      are on the right track.</p>

    <h3><u><strong>Tying or Pulling:</strong></u>
    <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>

    <div>
      <!-- ParagraphBodyStart -->

      <p>Well what you have done is taught him to
      pull.   Every time you used a
      weak rope or snap or poor tie point, you
      have taught him that if you pull you can
      get away.   So he has learned
      that lesson very well.
        Congratulations you are a horse
      trainer.   I say it all the time,
      when you are with a horse you are training,
      you are teaching good or bag, everything
      you do the horse knows, watches and learns.
      A horse does not miss much, since it is
      there job to notice EVERYTHING or they will
      die or get eaten.   Very simple
      to them, you pay attention or you die.
        So when you say he pulled a
      board off the wall and hit me, that implies
      he did something wrong.   I say
      YOU tied a horse to poor tie point and he
      pulled and you get hit by a board because
      of you poor decision to tie a horse to
      something that can be pulled away. That is
      why this is your fault and not the horses.
        Had you tied him to a strong
      and secure point then the wood would not
      have hit you, so YOU could have prevented
      this and it is not the horse's fault.</p>
      <hr>

      <p>  <strong>Question:</strong> I
      am 50 year old female. Rode quite a bit
      when I was young.   Got back into
      horses 5 years ago. 3 year old quarter
      gelding kept in corral surrounded by other
      horses.   Turn out everyday with
      others. Good manners will stand still with
      lead rope dropped to the ground. I can ride
      him on the streets with traffic, no
      spooking.<br>
      As soon as you tie him up he starts dancing
      in place, bobbing his head and lolling his
      tongue out the side of his mouth. Seems
      very nervous when he is tied.Vet checked
      and<br>
      Teeth have been floated.   Still
      does this even when tied up with other
      horses who are calm.   Does not
      set back but will dance for hours while
      tied up.   Stands still when
      untied.<br>
         <strong>Answer:</strong> This
      horse is a baby at 3, he has little
      patience.   If you hobble train
      him, you can hobble him when tied and he
      will learn to stand still.   If
      you tie him more, he will learn to stand
      still.   Tie him when you feed
      him, tie him when you brush him, time him
      when you saddle him and ignore the dancing.
        If you are reacting to his
      dancing then he is getting something from
      it, if you ignore it, he will eventually
      grow tired of it.   The more you
      tie him the better he will get.
        <br>
      <br>
      And so what if he dances, he gets some
      exercise, he helps wear down his hooves, it
      keeps him active, let him dance the night
      away.<br>
      <br>
      You may want to try and tie a couple of
      older horses on each side of him, they will
      not put up with him movements and may
      correct him for you, he may feel better and
      safer and calm down then can reduce to one
      after a few weeks and then no horses after
      a few weeks.</p>

      old TB mare. I have known her for 7 years
      now. I bought her about 5 years ago and had
      her for 3 of those years and never had an
      issue with her. She was stolen from me and
      I just recently found her and got her back.
      For some reason When ever she is tied she
      freaks, rears, falls, and gets hurt. I have
      been tacking her in her stall or just
      having her stand with the rope over her
      neck but I really want to be able to work
      through her problem without her getting
      hurt! What should I do?<br>
      <br></p><strong>Answer:</strong> You say
      she freaks out, she is scared and may be
      telling you that she does not trust or
      respect you enough to be tied.
        I have a web page on tying a
      horse, read that and it will help.<br>
      <br>
      You say she rears, I say you are not tying
      her short enough to stop her from rearing.
        Tie her short with a good rope
      halter, NO buckles or snaps that can break,
      and when she pulls freaks or falls, just
      stand back and DON'T get involved or help,
      let her figure out that pulling gets her
      nothing.   Just be there in case
      you need to help, but don't help unless she
      stops moving and jumping.   You
      have to make sure and tie her safely so
      can't get hurt when she jumps around, she
      will get tired of pulling.<br>
