        I Don't Ride Any Horse in a Bit<br />
        <br />
        A bit is designed for one thing "PAIN", I don't care how people try to
        justify it, people that use a bit are hurting their horse and are not
        true horsemen. Fear and lack of understanding of the horse is why most
        people think they need a bit. Bits are big business, tricks gimmicks,
        special this and special that all things to confuse people that bits
        control horses when in fact bits do and are designed to do one thing -
        CREATE PAIN COMPLIANCE - pain = fear = flight or fight.<br />
        <br />
        It comes down to confidence in you and your horse, if you are scared, if
        you don't trust yourself or your horse, you will mistakenly think that a
        bit will help you - It won't, it will only increase the pain and
        confusing in the horse and will stop communication. No one hears much
        when they are in pain and being hurt.<br />
        <br />
        Stop being fooled, stop being played, stop listening to others that
        don't know any better. I have a standing offer, any horse that can be
        ridden with a bit, I will ride in a rope halter in under an hour. Send
        my 1000 bucks and a round trip ticket, if I can't do it, it won't cost
        you a thing - the problem is no will put their money where their mouth
        is - most are too scared to be proven wrong since it might mean they no
        longer have an excuse to use a bit. Every horse I have done this with,
        the owners normally come back with well this horse much like you or you
        are a horse whisperer and I am not, the excuses will always justify
        their fear to continue using a bit. Other excuses I hear is my sport
        won't allow bitless or my breed of horse does not do well without a bit.
        Here is a picture that proves that excuse wrong.

        Below is a picture of a woman's horse that she LOVED, and said it was
        being stubborn and would giving her trouble taking the bit - "NO SHIT" -
        this is what the Vet found when she looked, the bit was being yanked and
        pulled so much and so hard that it was cutting horses tongue off - yet
        every person that rides a snaffle bit wants to say bits don't hurt
        horses. The ignorance of people who are scared never stops amazing me.
        Once again, bits are designed and used for ONE thing-
        <strong><u>Pain Compliance.</u></strong> <u></u>

      The below picture makes it very clear. The brown horse with
      <strong>NO BIT</strong> has his head where it needs to be is balanced,
      level and NOT in pain. Conversely the White(Gray) horse, is OFF balance,
      in PAIN, the rider is pulling the horse back hurting his teeth and gums.
      Yet many bit lovers will still defend cruel, archaic metal pain devices
      called bits.

          >Here is the Conclusions of a Study Done On Bits Verses
          Bitless:</strong
        ><br />
        <br />
        <u>Conclusions</u><br />
        <br />
        Horses wearing the bitted bridle exhibited more chewing, opening of the
        mouth, pawing the ground, and tail swishing than those in the bitless
        bridle. The horses wearing the bitless bridle exhibited more head
        lowering during long reining compared to those in the bitted bridle. The
        frequency of chewing, opening the mouth, and head raising decreased as
        training progressed. During long reining, the number of steps taken
        after the application of the halt stimulus was greater for the horses in
        the bitted bridle compared with those in the bitless bridle. During long
        reining, the heart rate and heart rate variability were higher for
        horses in a bitted bridle compared with those in a bitless bridle. If
        the use of bitted bridles does cause discomfort to horses, as suggested
        by some, then the use of bitless bridles could be beneficial and
        certainly warrants further investigation. In the interest of the welfare
        of horses in training, there is a need to conduct further work in this
        area, using larger numbers of horses, to determine conclusively the
        benefits of using bitless bridles in preference to bitted bridles.<br />

        "They have never learned that the bit is for communication, NOT CONTROL!
        When we try to rely on the bit for control instead of communication, our
        approach to training and problem solving becomes a matter of trying to
        contain a wreck."<br />
        <br />
        Steve Jonkheere "Steve's Intelligent Horsemanship Principles"<br />
        <br />
        I wanted to write this article for sometime but kept putting it off
        because I was concerned that it A) I would not do the topic adequate
        justice. B) that it might take volumes to really cover the topic of
        bits.<br />
        <br />
        So, instead, I have decided to keep it as basic as possible and use
        generalities instead of too much detail. Yes, there are always
        exceptions to every rule but for the somewhat limited space I have
        available, I will only concern myself with generalities. The rest, well,
        that's up to you to discover and find during your horsemanship
        journey.<br />
        <br />
        The subject of bits, and their use, has been a topic of debates among
        horsemen and horsewomen for decades equal only to debates concerning
        Creationism vs. Evolution and the ever unpopular 1st Amendment vs.
        Separation of Church and State and yes, while I am being silly, to most
        horse owners, the debate on bits is a very serious matter.<br />
        <br />
        People incorrectly assume that I am against bits not at all. Not even
        close. What I AM against is the uneducated way we think about bits the
        uneducated way we use bits and the uneducated hands that pull, jerk and
        manipulate bits in a horse's mouth. Now THAT is what I am against.<br />
        <br />
        Now here is where I am about to get flamed and chided for my opinions
        first almost everyone agrees that in training, horses do not need bigger
        bits the bigger bit theory comes from those who are either looking for a
        quick fix to a problem which usually stems from a serious hole in a
        horse's training way back down the line or the bigger bit is used to
        compensate for the uneducated hands operating the reins or lack of good
        horsemanship skills.<br />
        <br />
        If you find that you are needing to go into a bigger bit of any kind, or
        a severe mechanical hackamore. then you need to re-evaluate yourself and
        your horse's foundational training. There is a serious hole in the
        training - either yours or your horse's. Period.<br />
        <br />
        Even Dale, Ron and Bob Myler, makers of Myler bits, state this truth in
        their book "A Whole Bit Better". In fact, they even go on to say that if
        your horse is resisting the bit you don't move up into a more severe
        bit, but rather move back down into a smoother snaffle and begin
        re-training.<br />
        <br />
        Wait a minute. Softer? With resistance? Yes, go exactly the opposite as
        you might have learned. Take the horse as soft as he will allow. When
        the horse is resisting the current bit, it's too much bit for him and he
        can't relax. Your communication to him is not being properly received.
        Go to a softer bit so he doesn't resist, can relax and accept what you
        are communicating. It is important to remember, however, that the bit is
        only a tool. A bit will not train your horse. Proper training takes
        time, patience, and repetition. And you need to have the correct tools
        to communicate what you are asking the horse to do - hands, legs, seat,
        voice and proper equipment."<br />
        <br />
        Dale, Ron, and Bob Myler "A Whole Bit Better"<br />
        <br />
        Even this very mild Myler Comfort Snaffle can be a torture device in the
        wrong hands and with the wrong idea of how it works.<br />
        <br />
        Okay, so we understand that in the early stages of training we need
        re-training and not a bigger bit in fact, to borrow a 'Parelli-ism' here
        "bigger brain vs. bigger bit".<br />
        <br />
        But then the horse's get so smart that we need a bigger bit so the
        traditional rule of thumb is to go up into a curb bit and according to
        the experts, your horse apparently gets so smart that he has to go up
        into even a bigger bit such as a Santa Barbara Spade bit for ultimate
        refinement and if he isn't into this bit, then he isn't refined or
        'finished'. HORSE BISCUITS!<br />
        <br />
        I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THAT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT!<br />
        <br />
        I guess all the upper level dressage horses being ridden in D-ring
        snaffles aren't "finished" horses ? I guess all the fancy maneuvers, the
        pirouettes, piaffes and the passage are all elementary school movements
        and these horses still have a long way to go in their training ? These
        finely trained horses are most certainly "finished" horses.<br />
        <br />
        Most recently, the idea of a horse not being "finished" unless they are
        in a full spade bit style bridle comes from those who train in the
        Vaquero tradition. Don't get me wrong, the Vaquero tradition and it's
        philosophy and principles produce some of the finest horses, but it is
        most certainly not the last word on training horses. In fact, lately
        there seems to be a shift toward any form of 'natural training' stemming
        from those who advocate the Vaquero tradition. Don't believe me? Take a
        look at the horse industry magazines and you see it's influence
        throughout all the pictures and articles.<br />
        <br />
        Look, the Vaquero way, the way I see it, is not the final word on
        horsemanship or training. It is a discipline. Much like saying English
        is a discipline or Western is a discipline.<br />
        <br />
        Tell me, what does a Santa Barbara spade bit, romel reins, bosalito with
        horsehair mecate, chinks, expensive Garcia spurs, and flat crowned
        Spanish Cordoba styled hat have to do with English riding? Absolutely
        nothing. So I guess all those millions of people riding and training
        English style all over the world are wasting their time because their
        horses will never be a high caliber finished horse, right? NOT!!!<br />
        <br />
        But there are those who jump up to defend the Vaquero way and say that
        it isn't the tack, but rather the principles and concepts involved in
        that disciple which will make fine horses. EXACTLY !!!!! So a horse, any
        horse, can be "finished" and not have to be ridden in a giant heavy
        silver inlaid Santa Barbara spade bit.<br />
        <br />
        The other problem that I find with this seriously flawed thinking comes
        from clinicians themselves. That's right, WE are to blame for the
        problems that are arising out of uneducated people putting college level
        bits into their elementary school level horses and compounding bitting
        problems.<br />
        <br />
        In the last 10 years, we have seen great horsemen and horsewomen produce
        tape series which teach someone how they can, in the privacy of their
        own home, gentle and start a 2 or 3 year old under saddle and some even
        spout off it can be done in an hour or less. What we are encouraging
        here is for somewhat green riders to buy young green horses and start
        the horses themselves and immediately after the snaffle bit, they put a
        5 inch shank curb bit in the horse's mouth for "control" and stopping
        power. I have seen these bits in the mouths of horses who were barely
        over 2 years old !!!! Again, that's like trying to communicate in high
        school English Lit level conversation to a horse who is still learning
        about "See spot run. Run spot, run". And what does the Vaquero tradition
        teach after that? Well, you did fine now, so if you really plan on
        "finishing your horse" you need to put him up into a Santa Barbara Spade
        bit.<br />
        <br />
        BUT WAIT - Has anyone even bothered to take the time to teach these home
        grown Vaquero video aficionados on how to use their hands so that they
        can communicate through that loud bit and it be only a whisper?! 99% of
        the time, they have not. So the backyard homeowner buys a clinician's
        tape series and then proceeds to buy a very college level bit and puts
        it in their young horse's mouth but their own hands may still be 1st or
        2nd grade level. What do you think is happening in that horse's
        mouth?!!! What type of communication do you think we are having with our
        horse's at that moment?!!! Those reins connected to those spade bits
        need to be trained .if you are going to use a college level bit, you
        need college level hands!!! Nothing else will suffice. Period.<br />
        <br />
        Also, the Vaqueros didn't finish a horse in one year or even two years
        horses weren't considered full bridle horses - finished horses - until
        they were 6 or 7 years old not 2 or 3 years old !<br />
        <br />
        "Most people believe that you should start a horse with a really quiet
        bit, so-to-speak. Then the further along in the horse's training you go,
        the bigger the bit you should automatically put in his mouth because it
        takes a bigger bit for him to understand more. People think that there's
        a direct relationship between what a horse knows and what kind of bit is
        in his mouth. What actually happens is that the horse gets used to the
        bigger and bigger bits. Eventually, you need the bigger bit because the
        horse is used to the beating he gets with it every day. Horses are so
        sensitive that they can feel a fly land on their skin. They can feel and
        understand a mild bit if the rider knows how to use it. But you can't
        train in shouts and show in whispers. When you put a bit in the horse's
        mouth that multiplies your pressures you lose your corridor of aids."<br />
        <br />
        Ron Meredith "Loud Bits Destroy Communication" online article
        www.meredithmanor.com<br />
        <br />
        One last thing again, blaming the current Vaquero fad for a lot of the
        misconceptions that we hold as the 'norm' in today's horse world, the
        Spanish word for bit is "Freno" which translates to the English word
        "Brakes" So even within the Vaquero tradition there lies misinformation.
        If they teach that bits do not control horses and that it is a
        communication tool, why then do they use a word that literally
        translates into "brakes" ? In other words, "brakes" stop horses brakes
        control horses. Confusing isn't it?<br />
        <br />
        And again, Don't take my word for it I would never post anything that
        you can't go check out for yourself go to any online free translation
        website and type in the word "freno" or the word "brakes" and you will
        get the other word in translation. So let's change direction here a
        minute log on to almost any general horse training internet message
        board and you will find dozens of posts asking the same question.<br />
        <br />
        "Which bit do I use?" "Help me get control of my horse!" "Help, I can't
        stop my horse!" "My horse runs through the bit!!" etc., etc these type
        of questions are endless.<br />
        <br />
        Despite the fact that several competent, experienced and knowledgeable
        people offer the advice of beginning training again and dropping back
        down into a basic snaffle bit, the majority of responses still boil down
        to using a bigger more severe bit to get the horse to listen.<br />
        <br />
        Why? Well the excuses are as plentiful as there are bits in a catalog<br />
        <br />
        Because their trainer has good success with Tom Thumb bits or because
        their other horse acts just fine in a mechanical hackamore or the ever
        popular horses are individuals and some need to have a bigger bit to
        control them.<br />
        <br />
        And some people ignorantly fall for such erroneous advice because they
        wont take the time to explore and discover the answers for themselves
        they just want the problem fixed without having to go through some real
        problem-solving sweat. And of course, the problem never stems from the
        bad hands why everyone on these internet boards have absolutely perfect
        hands because they have been riding for years and their grandpa taught
        them to ride and he was the best rider they had ever seen. Yadda, yaday,
        yadda Okay, okay, you get the picture.<br />
        <br />
        The other reason why they search for the better controlling bit is that
        they tend to blame the horse. It seems that everyone on the internet has
        perfect hands by golly, they have all been riding since they were three
        and they know how to ride yep, they are all perfect in the communication
        of their aids so the fault must lay blame on the horse no, No, NO!!!<br />
        <br />
        The simple truth of the matter is BITS DO NOT CONTROL HORSES !<br />
        <br />
        If bits controlled horses and stopped horses we would never have stories
        of a horse "running through the bit". If bits controlled horses, we
        wouldn't have over 300 bits and custom parts for bits in one single
        catalog. We would have maybe 2 bits and that would be it but instead
        someone found a flaw in a particular bit and began modifying the bit
        until it became something else .and so on and so on. Look in the most
        recent National Roper Supply catalog and count how many bits, versions
        of bits and custom bit parts there are in the catalog. It will
        absolutely astound you!<br />
        <br />
        Someone once asked me via email, if bits do not control horses then how
        do we get control over a horse and how far down the line do we need to
        go to re-train and eventually 'finish' a horse? Great questions! Control
        comes from controlling 5 very small, but VERY significant things<br />
        <br />
        A) The horse's mind<br />
        B) The horse's four feet.<br />
        And these things are very closely connected and inter-mingled.<br />
        Okay, I can already see you guys rolling your eyes and letting out this
        long sigh I make no apologies here this is the truth no matter who says
        it and regardless of the individual horse.<br />
        <br />
        Long before you can ever willingly move a horse physically, long before
        you can ever stop a horse physically, turn a horse, side pass a horse,
        jump a horse, etc long before any of those physical actions can be done,
        there must be a yielding of the horse's mind and once the horse yields
        to you mentally, the feet follow right along and when the feet follow
        along willingly, the body just naturally does what you want it to do. It
        is the same way an in uncontrollable situation as well. If the horse is
        scared the mind will cause the feet to act in a certain way .prance,
        spin, RUN!<br />
        <br />
        On the trail, when a rider does not have the horse's mental and
        emotional components under control, what do you see? A horse that speeds
        up all the time, a horse that cant walk slow because the other horses
        are getting too far ahead, a horse that will jig and toss it's head, and
        a rider who is having to fight their horse the entire time. What a
        physically and emotionally draining experience. Instead of enjoying our
        horses and creating partnerships, these people spend their entire lives
        trail riding the same old horse in the same old way with the same old
        training using the same old tack but they expect different results. Now
        THAT'S insane!!!<br />
        <br />
        "Bits are a mystery to most people. The most common misconception seems
        to be; the bigger the misbehavior, the bigger the bit you need to
        correct it. I, on the other hand, teach people why they really don't
        even need a bit to control their horses. In most cases it's a revelation
        for the person and a relief for the horse. Horses run off or bolt out of
        fear. Its starts in the mind, goes through the body and down the legs to
        the feet. Once the horse is this frightened the rider is essentially
        riding scared feet. Most of the time it doesn't matter what bit is being
        used in the horse's mouth he can't be stopped. I've seen horses with
        huge shank bits, martingales and nosebands stick their chins on their
        chests and go! When prey animals get that emotional, and they need to
        save their lives, they will run through anything, painful or not."<br />
        <br />
        Pat Parelli "A BIT OF SAVVY: Where, When and Why To Use A Bit" online
        article www.parelli.com<br />
        <br />
        "A bit doesn't mechanically slow a horse down. Horses must be taught
        what the use of the bit means and must have an incentive to respond to
        it's message. But novice riders generally don't understand this and
        think of the reins and bit as brakes, that somehow pulling on a bit
        mechanically affects a horse's speed." John Lyons "Communication Through
        Cues pt 2" page 121<br />
        <br />
        Do tough horses really need tougher bits? Big bits are used when the
        common belief is that to get control of a horse, you have to over-power
        him. Having to use a bigger bits a sure sign you have little or no
        communication with your horse's mind." Pat Parelli "Level 1 Partnership
        Pack<br />
        <br />
        Now I can hear a lot of you already saying, "Yeah, okay, I understand
        that I have to control the mind and emotions to be able to control the
        feet, but that takes time and I need to control this horse now. So what
        can I do?"<br />
        <br />
        GET OFF OF THAT HORSE !!!<br />
        <br />
        If you are in such a rush that you cannot spend the time it takes to
        develop that mental, emotional and physical connection with your horse -
        or any horse for that matter - then you have no business riding that
        horse!!! That applies to trainers and clinicians as well!!! Get off that
        horse because you are essentially riding a "train wreck waiting to
        happen". Look, if you think I am going to suggest some magical piece of
        tack that is going to solve the horse industry's problems or give you a
        10 second cure all exercise, then you are mistaken and you really don't
        know what I am about and how strongly I feel about my philosophy of
        horsemanship. First, it wont do the horse justice second, it will most
        probably endanger you and get you hurt third, I just don't work like
        that.<br />
        <br />
        So how far back down the line do we have to go to get control of the
        horse's mind and feet? Well, all the way back to square one if need be.
        It doesn't matter if the horse is weanling or if the horse is a 20 year
        old senior. To gain control of the horse we have to go back to the place
        where we lost control to begin with at the beginning.<br />
        <br />
        Remember, just like a horse's body needs training for a particular task,
        so does his mind and emotions. We control the body by controlling the
        feet and we control the feet by controlling the mind and emotions. Too
        often I see people trying to hold back a 1000 pound horse by pulling
        back with all their might and yet the horse continues to buck, or run
        off. They are still trying to control the physical component of the
        horse. Part of the reason is that they don't understand where their hole
        is in the horse's training (and the rider's as well). They also see the
        reins as something connected to the face. When I am riding a horse in a
        clinic, any horse, rarely do I use a bit regardless of whose horse it
        is. When I trail ride I never use a bit. Usually we will run into other
        riders along the trail and inevitably someone will ask why I am riding
        without a bit and how do I go about stopping my horse or turn his nose
        in the direction that I want to go. Again, they still believe that reins
        and bits control horses.<br />
        <br />
        Let me take a moment and explain something here. Even when you use a bit
        any bit the reins ARE NOT connected to the face the reins are "attached"
        to the horse's face, but they are "connected" to the horse's feet. All
        four feet to be exact. But this is a difficult concept for some people
        to understand.<br />
        <br />
        Instead of thinking horizontally, that the reins are connected from your
        hands straight out horizontally and connected to the face begin to think
        VERTICALLY that the reins are actually connected from your hands
        straight down to the horse's feet like a puppet master working a
        marionette. How's that for visualization? Does that paint a picture of
        what I am trying to convey?<br />
        <br />
        Ray Hunt did a wonderful job of demonstrating this concept during the
        Tom Dorrance Benefit in Fort Worth He was speaking on horsemanship and
        was riding this mare who was getting a little busy with her feet. He not
        only thoroughly explained the concept but proved it as well for all to
        see. What a great way to see this first hand to watch the master,
        himself, teach this concept.<br />
        <br />
        Let's get back to the main point of this article So control begins with
        mental and emotional control so how do we achieve that? How do we get
        it? Well to give you a step-by-step method would take volumes for me to
        detail out here but let's start with this being uncontrollable is a
        problem and all problems fall into one of, or a combination of, four
        categories these are:<br />
        <br />
        SELF PRESERVATION<br />
        <br />
        Trust - Respect - Communication<br />
        <br />
        Notice that I put Self Preservation above all else and in bold block
        letters. That is because nature put it above all else in the horse's
        DNA. There is nothing that we can do to change that fact. When a horse
        becomes confused, frightened, excited, threatened, etc., he
        automatically switches from being left brained to right brained and Self
        Preservation kicks in. The need for fight or flight comes from his right
        brain. Logic goes right out the window when the switching of brain sides
        occurs. This is who he is as a prey animal and his very existence relies
        on Self Preservation being the number one thing in his life.<br />
        <br />
        The first responsibility that falls on the human is Trust. It is the
        essential building block that all horse/human relationships, and
        partnerships, are built upon. Before anything else, a horse must first
        have to trust you to truly give of himself and ignore his instinctual
        Self Preservation .<br />
        <br />
        The second responsibility that a human has to shoulder is earning
        Respect. Now there are a lot of similarities between Trust and Respect
        when dealing with a horse. The two almost have to go hand in hand. If
        you stop and think about it, you really can't have Trust without having
        Respect . They each are byproducts of one another. First a horse has to
        learn to Trust you. You earn the Trust by teaching him that, as his
        leader, you will not lead him into harm nor abuse him. His best care is
        in your hands. With this, he learns to Respect you. The more he Respects
        you, the more he will Trust you and the more he Trusts you, the more he
        will Respect you. It takes TIME (training principle #1) to earn and
        create a relationship built on Trust and Respect however. it literally
        only takes about 2 seconds to completely destroy the Trust and Respect
        and thereby destroying the relationship.<br />
        <br />
        The last responsibility that humans must shoulder is Communication . I
        find that in most cases, problems occur when there is a break down in
        Communication between horse and human. I will tell you in plain English
        right now that when it comes to miscommunication it is always the
        human's fault. We tend to be rather ego-centric and almost demand that
        every being understand our spoken language, intent, body language,
        thoughts, emotions, etc. Somehow we expect all to conform to human way
        of understanding. But horses don't think like we do. It is we humans who
        need to change our thought processes in order to better Communicate with
        horses.<br />
        <br />
        I have people tell me that their horses are tossing their heads, or
        being cinchy when they have always acted normal during saddling. They
        will explain how their horses are now playing hard to catch in the
        pasture and are constantly wringing their tails and pinning their ears.
        They immediately revert to using force or mechanical devices to correct
        problem. Again, they are attempting to stop the symptoms instead of
        curing the cause. All these little signals that the horse is giving us
        are signals. It is his way of talking. This is what his language is
        based on and we just sit back and simply ignore the conversations. Or we
        want to ask our horse to slow down so we pull back on both reins. Then
        later we want a transition of gait or leads and we pull back with both
        reins. When we want the horse to back, we pull back with both reins. If
        we feel we are losing our balance we tend to pull back with both reins
        and use them to balance ourselves. Through all of this we expect the
        horse to understand our intent yet the signal that we are giving them is
        exactly the same and very confusing. Once again, it is the human at
        fault in the miscommunication.<br />
        <br />
        So what we would like to do is invert that formula to look more like
        this:<br />
        <br />
        TRUST - RESPECT - COMMUNICATION<br />
        <br />
        Self Preservation<br />
        <br />
        Once we can invert the formula so that the horse's need for Self
        Preservation is reduced, we then can begin establishing a partnership in
        which the horse will look to us as their leader and this will give us
        control long before we ever put a bit in that horse's mouth.<br />
        <br />
        In fact, in my Less IS More Philosophy, all early training should be
        done without a bit ..in other words, I try to achieve vertical flexion,
        lateral flexion, backing, walk, trot, canter, stopping, side-passing,
        disengaging hindquarters, moving the forehand, lowering the head, etc
        ..all in a halter long before bitting a horse. Why? To preserve the
        horse's mouth and to preserve the horse's "try".<br />
        <br />
        Once we achieve these tasks and the horse is light and supple, then it
        is just a matter of adding the snaffle bit and REFINING the
        communication and REFINING my other aids.<br />
        <br />
        See, as I alluded to before ..control of a thousand pound animal comes
        from riding and controlling the mind and feet. I know that for some of
        you that is a hard concept to grasp. Why? Because you have always been
        taught to physically control a horse through physical means. This has
        been ingrained into your thinking whether you realize it or not. And
        it's probably not even your fault that you think this way. In your mind,
        the bigger bit theory is the accepted norm. Well, no longer. It's time
        to start doing some research and start raising your own level of
        horsemanship up to meet your horse's needs. Have you ever seen, either
        in person or on video, some of Pat and Linda Parelli's students? Now I
        am not advocating their program here I am just pointing out that if you
        had seen their students, you would see riders going about walking,
        trotting, cantering, jumping and just all around playing with their
        horses and doing it all bareback and in a rope halter or bareback and
        bridle-less!!! Those horses turn when they are supposed to turn, stop
        when they are asked to stop and back up when they are asked to back
        up.<br />
        <br />
        What you won't see are leverage bits or mechanical hackamores of any
        kind on any horse. WHY?!!! Forget the hype, forget what you hear and
        what you may, or may not, like about Pat and his program .have you ever
        asked yourself how do these riders maintain control of their horses?
        They are all just playing around having fun in absolute control. Take a
        look at the horses you wont see pinned ears, stressed bodies, wide eyes
        or wringing tails .even the horses look like they are having fun!!!<br />
        <br />
        They have achieved this by inverting the formula so that there is trust
        before respect and that trust and respect comes through great
        communication .and the investment of TIME (the number one training
        principle and tool in horsemanship). Look at pictures of our
        Grandaughter Janessa .you can see pics of her at age 3, 4 and now at age
        5 and see her riding her horse bareback and in a halter.<br />
        <br />
        Trust. Respect. Communication.<br />
        <br />
        Again, forget the hype and forget the egos and just look at the horses
        and the mental and emotional control (that's all that matters anyway)<br />
        <br />
        Horses don't lie, my friends .in fact, horses never lie So whether you
        have a horse that runs through the bit and cannot be stopped, or you
        have a horse that you can ride bareback and bridle-less they are living
        proof that<br />

    <p align="justify">
      Bosals and Hackamores were originally used to start colts in training.
      Since untrained colts make many mistakes, a hackamore does not injure
      sensitive tissue in the colt's mouth and provides firm and safe control.
      The term Hackamore and Bosal are interchangeable, however, technically the
      Bosal is only the rawhide braid around the nose of the horse. The hanger
      and reins together with the Bosal completes the Hackamore.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Parts of a Hackamore</strong> :<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackamore"
        target="_blank"
        ><u>Hackamore</u></a
      >
      came from Spanish culture and was derived from the Spanish word jaquima
      (hak-kee-mah). The parts of the Hackamore are:<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Bosal (boz-al):</strong>This is the part around the horse's nose
      usually made of braided rawhide, but it can be made of leather, horsehair
      or rope. The size
      <img
        align="left"
        border="3"
        height="116"
        src="images/adad.jpg"
        width="84"
      />and thickness of the bosal can vary from pencil size (thin) to 5/8 size
      (thick). The Bosal can vary in length and stiffness. A mutation of the
      bosal can have a cable or steel core. Traditionally, the core should be
      rawhide to make it pliable and fit closely to the horse's nose. Parts of
      the bosal are the nose button and cheek buttons, cheeks or shanks, and the
      heel knot. I like soft bosals, but when schooling a young horse, who may
      have more resistance, I use a stiffer and thicker one. I never use a cable
      or steel core bosal. They are heavy, do not give, will hurt the horse and
      will ruin any softness you are trying to achieve.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Mecate (meh-kah-teh):</strong>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackamore" target="_blank"
        ><u>Mecate</u></a
      >
      is a continuous rope, traditionally horsehair, that is wrapped around the
      cheeks of the bosal in a manner to<img
        align="right"
        border="3"
        height="81"
        src="images/ajfsjfs.jpg"
        width="106"
      />
      provide loop reins and a lead line. Other types of ropes are frequently
      substituted for the mecate but are used in the same manner. I like using
      Yacht rope that is used on sail boats. This rope is soft and is designed
      to be around salt water. Since a horse sweats salt, this will not damage
      or weaken the rope. Cotton is another good rope that is affordable, soft
      and works well. (You may hear a Mecate called a Macarty. This is a
      mutation by Americans of the word Mecate)<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Fiador (fee-ah-door):</strong> A
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiador_%28tack%29" target="_blank"
        ><u>fiador</u></a
      >
      is a rope throat latch that usually consists of a doubled rope that is
      passed around the neck just behind the ears and is attached to the bosal
      at the heel knot. It helps keep the bosal at right angles to the face of
      the horse. A variation of the fiador is the rope halter, also known as a
      natural halter.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Reins:</strong> When a Mecate is not used any reins can be used on
      a bosal. The problem will be securing them to the bosal. You can attach
      them the same way you do the Mecate.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Hanger/Headstall/brow band:</strong> These complete the hackamore
      and is usually made of leather, but small ropes or cords are also used.
      The headstall should be adjusted to raise or lower the bosal on the
      horse's nose. Brow bands are added to prevent the headstall from slipping
      back on the neck. A hanger is more of one piece of leather that runs from
      the Bosal to around the back of the horse's ears.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Fitting and adjusting a hackamore:</strong>A
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackamore" target="_blank"
        ><u>hackamore</u></a
      >
      must be properly adjusted to achieve the best results. It is placed low on
      the nose, near the soft cartilage, but not below it. Low placement assures
      maximum leverage and encourages flexion. The bosal should be short enough
      to make both nose and chin contact without sliding up the nose. To put
      more pressure on the nose than on the chin, adjust the bosal to allow a
      slight lift of the heel knot before the cheeks touch the horse's chin. If
      more contact on the chin is desired, the cheeks of the bosal should be
      precisely adjusted to make<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackamore"
        target="_blank"
        ><img
          align="right"
          border="3"

          src="images/yayayayayya.jpg"
          width="300"
      /></a>
      simultaneous contact with the chin and nose. Fitting is the most argued
      point about a bosal. Some like it higher and some like it lower. Lower
      will give more leverage and higher will give less movement. We are only
      talking about two inches or less of play. As long as it is not hurting or
      uncomfortable to the horse, it makes little difference. You can help make
      a bosal fit better by using a bosal shaper. The photo to the right shows
      how to shape it so it will fit better around the horse's nose. I have
      another link on my
      <a href="index-2.html" target="_blank"><u>horseman tips</u></a> page to a
      great site with good gear who sells a bosal block.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Making these adjustments will necessitate selecting a bosal length
      appropriate for a particular horse's nose. Sometimes finding the exact
      length needed is difficult. Bosals that are too short <u>cannot</u> be
      used, but those too long may be shortened by binding the cheeks tighter
      together with the mecate. Some Horsemen prefer to use bosals made from
      manila lariat rope (too rough for me). I like soft rawhide because - if I
      was a horse that is what I would want on me.

    <p align="justify">
      <strong><u>Braided Rawhide Bosal Care and Cleaning:</u></strong> <u></u>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Most good Bosals are rawhide and require minimal cleaning if cared for
      properly. Do not use oils on rawhide, conditioning cream works best. Two
      things that will damage rawhide are water and heat. Both will dry it out
      or rot it and will remove conditioning.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      If a bosal gets very wet, it will need to be dried to minimize this
      damage. The best way is to hang it from the heel knot not in direct
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Reins should be removed and allowed to dry in a straight manner. Don't
      hang rope/reins from metal that can rust or stain your gear. Wood, plastic
      or using a string to hand from metal are alternatives.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      When the bosal is dry, look at the edges of the rawhide strings to if they
      look fuzzy or feel rough. If they do, then they need conditioning. Ray
      Holes Vaquero Rawhide Cream seems to work best and gives good results. Rub
      and massage the bosal (or other rawhide) with the cream. As you rub in the
      conditioner, you may see it turn brown or dirty. If you want you can use a
      cloth, wipe away all the dirty cream, and then re-apply clean conditioner.
      Work in any excess conditioner with your hands, fingers and then use a
      clean cloth to remove any that can't be worked it. Then hang the bosal for
      drying, NOT in direct sunlight.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      You can use a block to shape a bosal or you can allow them to shape
      themselves by hanging them from the heel knot over a can nailed to the
      wall or a small piece of round fence post (about 3 inch in diameter) are
      two possibilities. When you finish riding, just hang your bosal upside
      down on the can, block or fence post to keep it open and ready for the
      next ride.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <strong><u>For Light Cleaning of the Bosal:</u></strong
      ><u></u>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      If you just want to clean your bosal you can use cool, clean water, a soft
      tooth brush, a towel and some Murphy's Oil Soap Paste or Fiebing's White
      Saddle Soap. The Murphy's paste is the better if you don't mind the slight
      yellow color. If you don't want to change the color of the rawhide, then
      choose the white saddle soap.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Rub the bosal with some of the Murphy's paste or white saddle soap and
      then dampen the tooth brush and use it to brush the braiding. Wipe off the
      dirt and suds with a cloth or towel. Never spray or wet rawhide with
      water. You want to use minimum water and try and keep it as dry as
      possible doing cleaning. Remove excess water and soap suds as soon as
      possible. Let it dry. If it looks like it needs conditioning, you can just
      rub it down well with the Murphy's paste or white saddle soap since that
      works as a light conditioner. Buff off excess conditioner with a soft
      cloth or towel. If it needs a deeper conditioning treatment, use the
      Vaquero Rawhide Cream as I described above.

      <u><strong>The severity of the bosal</strong></u> is important and lies in
      the hands of the rider. Severe contact can cause the horse to overreact to
      pressures. It is difficult to show the horse what you want if it
      distracted by pain. Too soft of contact can result in the horse
      disregarding completely what the rider is trying to show it. Hardness and
      rigidity of the bosal are a couple of prime factors affecting severity.
      Braided rawhide bosals that are large in diameter and have rigid cores can
      be severe. For extreme softness, bosals may be made from soft cotton rope.
      The severity of bosals may be varied by adding or removing certain
      cushioning materials from the cheeks and nose button. Many materials are
      satisfactory for this purpose; the most commonly used is sheepskin. Soft
      Hands is the key to any training.

    <p align="justify">
      Weight at the heel knot of the bosal should be sufficient to cause instant
      release of chin pressure when the rider quits pulling and the horse puts
      his head in a neutral position. When the fiador is used, it must be loose
      enough to allow this release of chin pressure and tight enough to prevent
      the bosal from slipping off the nose. A fiador also helps the bosal to
      balance when the head is neutral. Use of a hackamore is based on the
      simple principle that the horse learns to respond to pressures on its nose
      and under its chin.

      <u><strong>Tying A Mecate:</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <strong>Tying a Mecate</strong> onto the bosal is simple once you do it a
      few times. I have attached some pictures that demonstrate this so it may
      be easies. In the pictures the bosal is hanging as if it was on a horse,
      so the tassle is hanging toward the ground. In the forth picture is where
      you are making your reins, you can make them as long or as short as you
      like by just adjusting how much rope you pull in step four. So the loop in
      step four is going up and over your horses head. The last picture is
      securing the rope and making your lead rope with the end of the Mecate.
      Notice the last loop sends the end of the rope the same way as the start
      tassel and opposite as the reins. You should be able to copy and blow up
      these pictures for more detail.

      <strong><u>Biggest Mistakes When Using a Hackamore</u>:</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <strong>Hard or rough hands</strong>. If you pulling and fighting with the
      horse you have not prepared him correctly. A horse has to respect you and
      the bosal. If you have done your ground work properly, your horse will
      trust you and will accept the bosal without much resistance. If you throw
      it on the horse and start trying to force the horse, he will associate the
      bosal with pain and will never accept it. Riding with a bosal, NO BIT, is
      a purer form of horsemanship. People that use bits, any bits, are cheating
      themselves and the horse. Using a bit is easier and will cover up what you
      lack in understanding the horse. You can force and use pain to get a horse
      to do most anything. To get a horse to respond with ease and to ride as
      partnership is a dance that both you and the horse enjoy. I believe the
      absolute key to handling reins is minimal movement. Reins are not used for
      balance, security or forcing head movement. They are an extension of the
      soft touch of your hand. Move them less, move them soft and only move them
      if you want the horse to do something. <strong>For The Record</strong> I
      prefer riding in a rope halter over anything else. Many do not trust or
      have confidence to ride in a rope halter, so they like the bosal better,
      they think, they ARE wrong, that a bosal gives more control than a rope
      halter and a bit gives more control than a bosal and bigger harsher bit
      give the best control. This all so wrong on so many levels, but
      <strong>there are none so blind as those that do not want to see.</strong>
