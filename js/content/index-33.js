      I found this in a document that I had filed under add to web site. I am
      not sure where I found it or where the source is, so I cannot reference
      the source, so if anyone knows where this is please let me know. I have
      modified and added things to help relate it to horses. The basic
      definition of Herd Behavior is spelled out well here. Understanding this
      will help you to better understand where a horse comes from and how they
      see the world and how their reactions are instinctual and by design, not
      by some freak or accident.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      If you�ve ever watched a nature show about herding animals, you may have
      seen what a stampede looks like, that sudden chaotic movement when a herd
      of animals panics, normally from fear and begins to break in every
      direction. Stampedes are not planned events, but they tend to affect the
      entire herd, and they can lead to disastrous results such as animals
      injured or trapped. A stampede may also have positive or beneficial
      results, like most of the animals escaping a predator, a baby being saved
      by confusing the predator or the predator gets hurt, all of which protects
      the herd�s survival.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      These unplanned incidents and sometimes violent acts are called "herd
      behavior, and the term has been applied to many aspects of human culture.
      Though we may think we are individuals, groups of people may act in
      concert, especially in situations that leave little time for
      decision-making (fear or panic). Like the herd stampeding, herd behavior
      in humans may have negative or positive consequences.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The term herd behavior as it applies to humans first appears in
      <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Instincts-Herd-Peace-Wilfred-Trotter/dp/1596050764"
        target="_blank"
        ><strong
          ><u
            >Dr. Wilfred Trotter�s 1914 book Instincts of the Herd in Peace and
            War.</u
          ></strong
        ><u></u
      ></a>
      It wasn�t exactly a new idea, though Trotter can be credited with the
      phrase. Sigmund Freud, for instance, extensively discusses his ideas of
      crowd psychology, and Carl Jung suggests that such psychology is the
      result of universal or collective unconscious. If you have read my article
      on the Horse learning model (see my articles page), you will see how
      conscious and unconscious behavior leads to thinking and reacting behavior
      which reactionary behavior is considered instinctual, unless it is learned
      or taught.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      You may see many examples of herd behavior in economics. For instance, if
      a few people begin to sell a certain type of stock, it may lead to a mass
      selling spree, panic, and leave the market open to crashing. Similarly,
      you might look at the behavior in the retail environment on day after
      Thanksgiving sales (known as Black Friday). People have been injured in
      attempting to get to a special item offered at a very good price, when the
      doors of a store opens and the crowd stampedes in. Such stampedes have
      also occurred at rock concerts with open seating, where all people try to
      rush to get the closest seats to the front. Remember Tickle me Elmo or
      Beanie Babies, people were stealing, waiting in line and fighting over
      these items. These have occasionally had tragic results. Other areas that
      this plays in is Gangs, people join and belong to Gangs for a sense of
      being, belonging, safety in numbers, to have power, feel secure and safe
      in their area. Teenagers and school kids will smoke to be cool or
      accepted, they will join band or sports or some group that enable them to
      belong or to be with the same type of people, where they connect or feel
      safe. Look at sporting events where crowds of people yell and cheer for
      their teams, they get protective, where the same colors and dislike and
      opposite team. As the crowd cheers or boo's the fans join in and mod up.
      In riots, people get caught up in the violence and excitement and chaotic
      behavior and then that attitude continues to grow and progress and soon
      you have a stampede.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      One aspect of herd behavior that is often noted is that the herd is not
      completely interested in protection of the group. Instead self-interest
      (self-preservation) is a primary motivator. Herd animals, when they fear a
      predator, work to get into the center of the herd so they are less
      vulnerable and safer. Just as people have only self-interest in mind when
      they knock over others to get to a cheaply sold item, or the front seats
      of a rock concert; or even more so when they start selling or purchasing
      stocks to either make a profit or make an investment that will prove
      profitable in the very near future. So when horses run people down, run
      into a fence or injury themselves when scared or fearful, people tend to
      blame the horse for being stupid or unreasonable, when in fact if they
      look at it objectively they would see it is pretty normal behavior and can
      be predicted and expected.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Such things as housing prices can be determined by herd behavior and may
      be augmented by reports. In 2007, the Santa Rosa, California Press
      Democrat featured an angry letter to the editor asking them not to write
      anything else on the declines in the housing market. The writer was
      concerned that continued reports were driving the price of his own house
      down; in other words, he feared the herd instincts of others who would
      panic and try to sell before home prices dropped more, which would only
      lead to a drop in home prices and a flooded market. I say this a lot when
      I tell people that work with horses that when you try and prevent
      something from happening, you end up causing it to happen.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Herd behavior may be called by other names like �mob mentality.� A sudden
      crisis or a demonstration that gets out of order may be subject to humans
      �herding� into violent clashes with others. More simply a large group of
      people herding into a single area can produce panic and stampeding, riots,
      violence, and huge death tolls. This relates to safety in numbers theory,
      the more we stick together, the more we increase our chances of
      succeeding, that may be different such as success in living, success in
      winning, success in victory, success in power, success in advantages. Same
      behavior, different motivations but normally predictable actions.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      There is also an innocent factor to herd behavior. People often look to
      others to see how to behave. Given a choice between two similar stores
      that are nearly empty, people almost always choose the store that has
      other people in it, representing desire to move with the �herd.� I call
      this the sheep behavior. People follow others much like sheep do and much
      like horses do. This internal need to be with our own kind, to feel safety
      in numbers, NOT to feel isolated, alone, or in solitude. Yet people still
      seem it is OK to lock a horse up and justify that it is not bad since they
      have another horse locked up next to them. Horses need a herd, they need
      their own kind, they need to feel safe, and they need to be able to move
      with the herd to feel in control of their own safety. Many reasons for
      horses to be together, but people, in their ignorance, continue to find
      reasons, excuses and justifications to lock up and isolate these beautiful
      herd and social animals.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Instinct is a complicated term, especially as applied to human health and
      wellness. In the animal world, minus human involvement, it is often easy
      to see that an animal species will have certain built-in factors or ways
      of being that cause them to act predictably in a variety of circumstances.
      Salmon will swim upstream to spawn at a certain time, many animals will
      attack anything that threatens offspring, a cornered animal will either
      fight, run, or play dead, and most animals have built in food-seeking
      behavior. Looking at this how can anyone see that locking a horse up,
      cornering a horse in stall, taking away the ability of a horse to flee or
      run, only leaves one option. <strong>And horse do NOT play dead.</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In humans, it is often suggested that modern technology makes people less
      in touch with their instinctual selves, and that they may be unhappy due
      to the fact that they are instinct driven or never use their instincts.
      What happens, for instance, to the child rearing/nurturing instinct when
      mom sees a baby for an hour at the end of a long workday, or how do
      instincts to perpetuate the species change when people use birth control?
      These questions do not represent a value judgment on such choices, but
      they may slightly change what things might be considered instinctual, or
      make people realize they are not acting in an �inborn� and traditional
      way, possibly creating discomfort. This is seen in horses when people try
      and "Imprint", or what many think imprinting is. This imprinting creates
      pressure, confusion and prevents the mother (mare horse) from teaching and
      bonding without human interference.
      <strong
        >Yet again, people will try and justify imprinting with myths about how
        it makes a horse safer or friendly or calmer, all wrong and does the
        Exact opposite of what it tries to do.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <center>
      Here is a link to more proof and studies about how

        ><strong>Imprinting is Bad.</strong></a

    </center>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p align="justify">
      There are also questions as to what things are truly human instincts or
      what are people�s inborn traits. There are a few examples commonly cited
      including instinct to survive, maternal instinct, and fight/flight
      response. Others do exist, but they may be difficult to argue as fully
      instinctual. In horses these instinct are much more pervasive and strong.
      <strong
        >Horse are prey animals, they are meat, they know that other animals
        hunt, kill and eat them, they do not have to be taught this, they are
        born with this extremely strong will to live and run.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Some people even argue about whether survival is an inborn trait. It is
      certainly not present to great degree in newborns, young children and even
      teenagers. People will do things like habitually eat, find a warm place to
      sleep and possibly fight if they�re threatened, but behavior of kids seems
      to be pose a constant and drawn-out exploration of the world that
      threatens survival continuously. This goes back to precocial species,
      which humans are not and horse are.
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" target="_blank"
        ><strong><u>Precocial Species</u></strong
        ><u></u
      ></a>
      are born more developed and know and are able to run, fly or flee for
      survival.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The opposite of Precocial is Altricial. So

      species.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      From the moment the baby puts the penny in his mouth and tries to choke on
      it to the instant when a teen drives off too quickly in a car, survival is
      continually being risked. Moreover, how does the firefighter run into the
      burning building to rescue others instead of keeping away from it, and why
      do instincts like hunger/survival lead to overeating that may shorten
      life? There is also a good argument to be made that collective behavior of
      the human species tends not toward survival but toward destruction of
      species, through support of various activities that may ultimately sharply
      reduce ability to produce food. People have much more complex brains than
      horses. They can think many steps ahead, they can predict, they can
      analyze, they can reason and remember a million times more than a horse.
      Because of this, they can ignore their instincts; they can make a
      conscious decision to go against their instincts since they can understand
      the consequences of that decision. Humans will evaluate, think, consider
      and can make reasonable and educated decisions, "A horse cannot do these
      things and to expect this from a horse just sets them up to fail.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Certainly, humans have some instincts that are considered very normal. The
      maternal instinct often arises when a baby is first put into the arms of
      the mother, and the reaction can be observed chemically by looking at
      increases in hormones. This does not always occur and conditions like
      post-partum depression may interfere with normal hormonal increases,
      changing mother/child interaction, unless a woman gets assistance. When
      the reaction is �as normal�, strong protective feelings for the child can
      flood the mother and many describe this as feeling a love that is very
      strong and intense, knowing that there is little they would not do to
      protect the child. Yet again, people want a horse to ignore this instinct
      and when a mother horse bits or kicks a person to protect their foal, they
      are labeled mean, aggressive, or bad moms.
      <strong
        >So many misconceptions with horse but since it is so wide spread, many
        think it is right and normal to blame a horse for being a horse.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The child instinctively needs the mother too, and in fact, without a
      consistent caregiver child development may dramatically decrease, and
      infant death can sometimes occur. Even when children�s needs are
      physically met, without a single caregiver and a infant/caretaker bond,
      anaclitic depression can develop, resulting in huge losses developmentally
      and sometimes in mental conditions like attachment disorder. This scenario
      has been observed repeatedly in orphanages and in hospital settings,
      suggesting strong social instinct in the newborn. Can anyone imagine if a
      horse came over and took a child from a mother to teach it to be with
      horses, can any of the "so called women experts that promote this" begin
      to understand how tough it is for a horse to allow a predator around their
      baby and not try and protect them? To me it is so clear, yet mainly women
      are the ones that promote this bonding and imprinting crap that is
      dominating the horse world. I would expect another mom to understand this,
      yet this very primal instinct is ignore and horse are made and forced to
      give up this right or get beat, blamed or labeled horrible names. Blaming,
      labeling and calling horse�s names predict their future both positive and
      negative.

        <u>horses with a past and no future.</u></strong

      Another observable human instinct is fight/flight reactions. In situations
      that are perceived to be dangerous, people may have huge increases in
      adrenaline that cause them to either rise to the danger and fight it,
      physically or otherwise, or quickly flee the scene. This can malfunction
      in humans too, and people with panic disorder may have an overly activated
      system that signals fight/flight response when no danger is present. In
      all people, danger may be real or perceived to be real, and it could be
      physical or theoretical. Much like horses can think a plastic bag is going
      to eat or harm him, when in fact a human can know that it is no danger.
      What people need to realize is it does not matter what we think or know,
      to the horse, a perceived threat is just as deadly as a real threat. Which
      is why sacking out, exposure, good handling and good desensitizing is what
      helps horses deal with real and perceived threats.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Perhaps the most difficult part about understanding human instinct is that
      human brains are complex and may sometimes
      <strong>override instinct or over express it.</strong> People seem less
      tied to instinctual behavior than are other animals, and centuries of
      philosophy and theology have been aimed at addressing the issue of whether
      the spirit can be stronger the flesh, with many religions certainly
      answering that it can. From a pragmatic and scientific standpoint, and not
      from a moral one, creating this intellectual divide between flesh/spirit
      may not be particularly healthful, since it also divides humans from what
      could be the most natural elements of their existence.

    <p align="justify">
      The fight or flight reaction, or fight or flight response was first used
      in the early 20th century by Walter Cannon, an American physiologist.
      Cannon used the term to describe animals that underwent situations, where
      they either had to flee or prepare to fight, in order to defend themselves
      from danger. Such a response can also be called hyper arousal, or a
      response to acute stress. According to Cannon�s descriptions, when an
      animal is frightened or imperiled, the sympathetic nervous system
      responds. This can cause dilated pupils, higher heartbeat, and extra
      strength shown in bursts of speed if an animal runs away or stays to
      attack. Some also refer to a third state �fright,� occurs when an animal
      doesn�t flee or fight, but panics and passes out or stands still � the
      typical �deer in the headlights� response or the collapse of sheep if
      chased by a dog. This is what people do when a horse reacts. When people
      are not prepared, are not ready for the unexpected, they said to black out
      or go into panic mode. When this happens, reaction time slows, thought
      process is slowed, reasoning ability is diminished and this lack of action
      is seen by a horse as weakness, lack of leadership and tells a horse not
      to trust this person in a crisis or you will die.
      <strong
        >Of course people who don't understand horses and who want to blame
        horses, will justify the horse's action as being stupid, spooky, herd
        sour, mean or dangerous and then the horse's fate is sealed.</strong

    Out on a ride and this baby colt came running over to say hi to Buddy.
    Keeping a rope halter on a horse in pasture unattended is not safe for a
    horse and can be dangerous. Here is a picture of what can happen:
    <a href="images2/halter danger.jpg" target="_blank"
      ><strong
        ><u>This is why you don't leave halters on in pasture.</u></strong
      >
      <u></u></a
    ><br />
    <br />
    This colt came over and pushed on buddy too fast which caused buddy to push
    back. There was a give and take and it was some play and some dominance and
    some submissiveness. The cold is lonely and needs herd interaction to learn.
    Keeping baby horses alone or "Imprinting" horses thinking humans can teach a
    horse better than a horse is BIG problem in the horse world and
    significantly contributing to all the unwanted horses and the thousands of
    horse shelters that are full.<br />
    <br />
    Not many listen to what they don't want to hear and then they all want help
    and run around asking for fixes to problems that they create. All good
    horsemen say don't get a young horse unless you are experienced with horses.
    Yet every, yes mainly women, wants a young horse to raise and take care of
    so they can grow and learn together. When an scared and uneducated horse
    owner gets a young horse, the only one that learns is THE HORSE. It learns
    you don't know, it learns you are scared, it learns to push and intimidate
    people. It learns that you can't control or stop it.<br />
    <br />
    Same with Imprinting crap. Oh I want a baby so I can imprint and teach it to
    like humans - BULLSHIT - the only think imprinting does, since it is mostly
    done wrong - is teach a horse that they are stronger, smarter and can push
    humans. WHY you ask is imprinting normally done wrong? BECAUSE IT IS ONLY
    DONE BY PEOPLE THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND HORSES BUT CLAIM TO LOVE HORSES.<br />
    <br />
    People won't listen but I will say anyway -<br />
    <br />
    DON'T get a young horse<br />
    DON'T imprint baby horses, let horses teach them<br />
    DON'T keep horses ALONE<br />
    DON'T leave horses in pasture with halters on<br />
    DON'T believe that horses give a shit if you love them - they only care what
    you do.<br />

      Fight or flight reaction has also been found to occur in humans during
      times of stress or danger. In some cases,
      <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"
        target="_blank"
        ><strong><u>the sympathetic nervous system</u></strong
        ><u></u
      ></a>
      causes such extreme boosts of adrenaline that people are able to do things
      they couldn�t under ordinary circumstances, like lift a car off an injured
      loved one. The fight/flight response can be extremely powerful, but it
      does not always work to our advantage.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      People may encounter the fight or flight reaction not just in situations
      of perceived physical danger. They may also feel imperiled during a vocal
      argument. This can cause them to continue arguing, and some people may
      even combine physical attack if their sympathetic nervous system works
      overtime during any type of verbal attack. Others need to flee, and if a
      person really wants to get out of a verbal argument, you should not try to
      stop him or her, since flight can be provoked into fight, if a person
      can�t get away from the attack and feels cornered. This is how horses
      panic and hurt themselves when people lock them up, pressure them in small
      enclosed places, like trailers or stalls, or when they prevent a horse
      from running - leaving the horse only one other option.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Moreover, some people, especially those with post traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, may have
      a fight or flight reaction for no apparent or obvious reason. The
      sympathetic nervous system essentially misfires, and suddenly being unable
      to find your keys, or something else mundane, causes a rapidly beating
      heart, heavy breathing, or an outright panic attack. For people with PTSD,
      small reminders of past traumatic events, like a smell, the temperature or
      being in a place familiar to where traumatic events occurred can provoke
      this response. For some, this can provoke aggressive behavior toward
      others, and yet others find themselves panicking or needing to change
      environments quickly.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Sometimes the flight response is not particularly overt in humans.
      Withdrawing from social interaction, even by watching television or
      surfing the net, could be viewed as a slight flight reaction when times
      get stressful. In studies on gender and fight or flight reaction it has
      been observed that men tend to become more aggressive or more withdrawn
      than do women under stressful situations, probably because in our culture,
      women tend to be more likely to lean on social resources (friends and
      family) to discuss their problems. This is where I get into trouble when I
      say why men are more successful than women with horses. When men become
      more aggressive, a horse sees this as leadership, strength and respect so
      a horse responds to this. When women tend to withdraw when confused,
      stressed or fearful, a horse sees this as weakness, lack of leadership and
      lack of respect. It has nothing to do with me being sexist or not liking
      women, it is a scientific fact that is not absolute, but more common than
      not.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      In all, most people will encounter fight or flight reaction (a herd
      behavior) in times of stress. Though it may have once been an instinctual
      behavior to protect people from danger, just as it now protects many
      animals, it is sometimes a hassle to deal with. Being in a full hyper
      arousal state can lead to bowel problems, panic, argumentative mood,
      withdrawal, and difficulty sleeping and breathing. If this response seems
      to occur frequently without stimuli, like a real danger or stressful
      situation unfolding, it may be wise to evaluate ways to address this
      response with a mental health professional or with your personal
      physician.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      By understanding why and how we, as people, as humans, as predators, do
      things and react and have very similar behavior traits, it will better
      help you to understand why a horse does the things it does. With
      understanding comes better communication and will hopefully prevent
      calling a horse names and labeling a horse with negative terms that tend
      to predict or cause the behavior we thing or believe we are seeing. Much
      like seeing a small child in run into the street and almost being killed
      by speeding cars. You would not call the child stupid, flighty, or crazy.
      You would blame the parent or care taker for not paying attention and
      blame them for not preventing the dangerous behavior. Yet with horses,
      rarely do I see people blaming the care taker or handler for what a horse
      does, it just seems more popular to blame the stupid horse.
