    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p align="justify">
      I do not want my videos or site used to promote arguments, petty comments,
      rudeness, poor or improper advice. Being in California, where there is a
      sleazy lawyer in every dark alley, just waiting to sue someone for
      something, I have to take reasonable steps to protect myself.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      The problem with hosting a site is I have to try and control some things
      and show I have taken prudent steps to stop poor or dangerous advice. By
      letting people give advice or tell others how to fix problems, it could be
      misunderstood or confused that I agree, support or condone the advice and
      then that could put liability on me. I cannot monitor all comments all the
      time. So
      <u
        ><strong
          >NO ADVICE is authorized, approved or condoned on my Youtube
          channel.</strong
        ></u
      ><strong></strong> I have posted that anyone seeing advice to notify me so
      I can delete it and I will block the person from future comments. So if
      you get blocked, don't come crying about how you did not know. I have
      already been threatened to be sued because some kid tried to do what I did
      in one of my videos. If you let your kids have a horse and roam the
      internet and then do not supervise your kids, it is not my fault. Kids
      should not be allowed around horses without supervision for many reasons,
      but the reason that irritates me the most is the horse will always get
      blamed or put down when a kid gets hurt.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      I have deleted many unauthorized advice comments and will continue to do
      so if I see it. Most States have a law that states something like,
      <strong
        >"Horses are wild, strong, reactionary animals and can be dangerous,
        anyone engaging in training, riding, being around or handling horses,
        are presumed to have this knowledge and therefore assume all risk,
        dangers and responsibility."</strong
      >
      So if are not aware of your laws in your state, you should check. Even if
      there is not this law, most reasonable people know this and are told this
      by other responsible horse people, trainers, barn managers and others in
      the horse industry. I assure you, I say it a lot in many different ways, a
      horse will kill you and kill himself trying to stay alive. If you deal
      with, work with, or around horses, and engage in horse activities,
      <u
        ><strong
          ><i
            >IT IS DANGEROUS, YOU CAN GET HURT OR KILLED AND YOU SHOULD KNOW AND
            UNDERSTAND THIS. NEVER DO ANYTHING ANYONE TELLS YOU SINCE YOU ARE
            THE ONE THAT CAN BE KILLED OR HURT.</i
