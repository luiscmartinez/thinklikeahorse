      Weather: the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time.
      Weather proverbs and sayings have been passed from generation to
      generation. People who make their living outdoors, like farmers, sailors
      and cattlemen, depend on predicting weather for their livelihood. Before
      Doppler radar, TV and computers, these people had become fairly proficient
      at predicting the weather. Today this is handy for trail rides, picnics,
      weddings or other outdoor activities. The following sayings and quotes can
      fairly predict weather for the next 12 to 24 hours.

      "Tails pointing east, weather's the least."<br />
      Horses and cattle usually graze facing downwind so they can smell any
      predator upwind of them and keep an eye open for anything approaching from
      downwind. A strong east wind indicates the approach of wet weather. A west
      wind, on the other hand, means fair weather.

      "When the rooster goes crowing to bed, he will rise with a watery
      head."<br />
      As the sky darkens from an approaching storm front, chickens and other
      birds begin to hunker down... roosting, as if for the night. A rooster
      will crow as an alert message to the rest of the flock -- to awaken in the
      morning, or to head for shelter when danger approaches. The calls of many
      birds, including crows and geese, have been known to be more frequent with
      falling pressure.

    <p align="justify"><strong>"A sunny shower won't last an hour."</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">
      <strong>"Birds fly higher in fair weather than foul."</strong> This is why
      duck hunters dislike blue skies. This may also be related to the fact that
      thinner low-pressure air makes flying more difficult for birds, so they
      tend to roost before a storm. High-pressure air, on the other hand brings
      good weather and allows birds to fly higher, where they can take advantage
      of more favorable winds.

    <p align="justify">
      Many springs that have gone dry will have a good flow of water before
      rain. High pressure air may reduce the flow of water from a spring, while
      the reduced resistance of a low pressure system will allow the water to
      flow more freely.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      "When swamps smell, sit home a spell. "Low pressure preceding a storm
      allows more odors to escape from swamps, ditches, sewers, etc. If the air
      suddenly smells foul, it often means that the weather will turn foul as
      well. A similar saying is: "When ditches and ponds offend the nose, look
      for rain and stormy blows." Likewise, the low pressure before a storm
      causes your body to release more insect-attracting odors; thus: "Flies
      bite before a flight." When insects become increasingly troublesome it may
      signal the approach of bad weather.

      "If a cat washes her face or her ear, tis a sign the weather will be fine

      very dry. During times of low humidity and fair weather, especially in the
      wintertime when it is very dry, a cat may lick its fur. In order to
      moisten it. Moist fur will shed electric charge and prevent static
      discharges, which annoy the cat.

      "If a circle forms around the moon, it will rain soon." The circle that
      forms around the sun or moon is called a halo. The light from the sun or
      moon refracting (bending) as they pass through the ice crystals that form
      high-level cirrus and cirrostratus clouds forms halos. These clouds do not
      produce rain or snow, but they often precede an advancing low pressure
      system which may bring bad weather.

    <p align="justify">
      "Rainbow in the morning, Shepherds take warning -- Rainbow at night,
      Shepherd's delight." A rainbow in the morning is formed when light from
      the rising sun in the east strikes and refracts through the water droplets
      in a rain cloud in the western sky. Rainbows always occur in the part of
      the sky opposite the sun. Since most storms (though not all) come out of
      the west, a rainbow in the western sky is a sign of rain. A rainbow in the
      eastern sky, as would occur in the evening, is a sign the rain has passed.

      Weather systems usually move from west to east. A reddish evening sky can
      be caused by sunlight shining through dry dust particles in the western
      sky. This dry sky may move overhead by morning. If the morning is gray in
      the east, it means the clouds have already passed you.

      especially blonde hair has a tendency to expand in length as the humidity
      rises. This may cause naturally curly hair to droop or it may cause
      straight hair to curl up a little. The higher the humidity, the more
      likely it is to rain.

      "Cold is the night -- When the stars shine bright." -- The more moisture
      there is in the sky, the more the light from the sun, moon, and stars is
      dimmed or reddened. A very clear sky permits more starlight to penetrate,
      thus the stars appear brighter. Moisture tends to hold in the day's heat,
      like a blanket. The less moisture there is in the air at night, the more
      the temperature tends to fall. Thus, the brighter the stars appear, the
      cooler is the night.

      the west to east, the morning rainbow indicates that rain is moving from
      the west toward the observer.
