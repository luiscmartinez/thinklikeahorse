      <strong>Training Horses &amp; Making Cookies</strong><br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Guys may not get this since most have never made cookies, but women who
      have made cookies will get it.&nbsp; Therefore, my Buddy�s wife makes some
      great chocolate chip cookies.&nbsp; Any time we have dinner she whips up a
      batch and cooks them up for desert.&nbsp; I have watched her make these
      cookies many times.&nbsp; Therefore, I asked her what is her secret for
      making such good cookies.&nbsp; Her answer was surprisingly simple.&nbsp;
      �The directions are on the back of the bag of the chocolate chips�.&nbsp;
      The answer was so simple, I felt like a dummy for asking.&nbsp; I said to
      myself, I am not an idiot, if the directions are on the bag and I have
      watched her do this many times, I can go get my own bag of chips and make
      my own cookies.<br />
      <br />
      So off I go, I get my chocolate chips, flour, oil, nuts and sugar.&nbsp; I
      cannot wait to eat some of those good cookies.&nbsp; I read the
      measurements for the ingredients on the back of my bag, measure them out
      and put them all in a bowl, stir them up, bake and they come out like
      crap.&nbsp; I was confused and frustrated.&nbsp; I put all the right
      ingredients in the right measurements and my cookies turned out like runny
      play doh and they did not taste much better.&nbsp; Now I bet right now,
      every one who has never made cookies is thinking, wonder what went wrong.
      I bet every person that knows how to make cookies knows exactly what went
      wrong.&nbsp;Hands on experience make the difference!<br />
      <br />
      Well being a guy, I called the expert (my trainer) cookie maker, explain
      that my cookies turned out like runny cow patties and asked what the hell
      happen?&nbsp; She asked a simple question, did you follow the
      directions?&nbsp; I said yes, I am not an idiot, I told her I put in
      exactly what the bag said to put in, mixed it up and baked them.&nbsp; She
      started laughing hysterically.&nbsp; Remember, I am still lost and
      confused about what is so funny about me wasting all morning measuring and
      stirring and all I get is rotten runny cookie dough that tastes
      horrible.&nbsp; She stops laughing long enough to ask me if I added each
      ingredient in the right order, like the directions said.&nbsp; I thought
      she was crazy.&nbsp; I�m thinking what difference does it make what order
      the stuff got mixed, all the ingredients were measured right and got mixed
      together anyway and then gets cooked, so why would it matter what
      order.&nbsp; Well, much to my surprise (take note guys), it makes a big
      difference.&nbsp; Not sure why, but it does, trust me.&nbsp; Not only does
      it matter what order, there also some rule about mixing verses stirring
      that I am still confused about.&nbsp; So to make a long story short, after
      several attempts and many dollars wasted, I now buy the pre-mixed cookie
      dough for my cookies.&nbsp; I cheat.&nbsp; I take the easy way instead of
      investing a lot of time and effort to do it myself.&nbsp; This is exactly
      what too many people do when it comes to their horse.<br />
      <br />
      So how does this relate to horse training?&nbsp; I admit I don�t know much
      about mixing cookie dough, but I do know horses.&nbsp; What I experienced
      with cookie dough is what a lot of people experience with horses.&nbsp; If
      training a horse is compared to making a good cookie, then if you watch
      someone else do something, and if you do it the same way (the way you
      think you saw it done), you should get the same results, right?&nbsp;
      Wrong. Just like I watched cookies being made and somehow missed a lot of
      little important steps and the results were not the same.&nbsp; If you
      just watch somebody do something with a horse, or you read a book
      (directions), or you try to train the horse from scratch, your end product
      will not be what you expect and will be much different than an experienced
      horseman would get. The difference is hands on experience.<br />
      <br />
      With cookie dough, the ingredients are the same, the way you mix or stir
      is the same and the directions are pretty clear (if you read them
      carefully).&nbsp; With horses not much of anything is the same.&nbsp; The
      environment changes, the weather changes, the horse changes with past
      experiences, fears, confidence and emotions.&nbsp; You change with how you
      are feeling, your confidence, your experiences, your confusion and your
      fear.&nbsp; Yet so often, I get questions from people wanting me to give
      them a fix to some horse issue that they see as a simple problem.&nbsp; I
      hear it all the time, my horse is perfect, but it walks off when I
      mount.&nbsp; On the other hand, my horse is great, except it bucks when I
      canter.&nbsp;Alternatively, my horse does everything great, only it rears
      and kicks when I lunge it.&nbsp; Horses are not cookies.&nbsp; There is
      not a clear list of directions with easily measured steps and ingredients
      that if followed, will always get the same results.&nbsp; With horses, if
      you take shortcuts, think you can do something since you saw someone else
      do it, or skip critical steps; you can end up with much worse
      results.&nbsp; A mistake in cookie dough means you throw out the dough and
      start over.&nbsp; A mistake with a horse can mean you are dead, seriously
      injured or hurt.&nbsp; However, I see many people doing with horses
      exactly what I did with cookie dough.<br />
      <br />
      When making cookies you do not have to worry about the blender spooking or
      what kind of day the eggs are having.&nbsp; With a horse, the variables
      are endless such as fear, flight, reactions, environment, equipment, you
      being one-fifth the size of a horse, you trying to control a horse that is
      30 or 40 times stronger than you, your training, your fear, your past
      experiences, the horse�s training, the wind, tractors, blowing plastic
      bags, cars, bikes, motorcycles, kids, other horses, all the volunteered
      advice you can take and many other things. All which will affect the
      outcome.<br />
      <br />
      With all this in mind, I see people everyday trying to control or train a
      horse without directions or knowledge of how bad things can turn
      out.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no clear definable and exact steps to training
      a horse.&nbsp; No perfect ingredients to get the same results.&nbsp; With
      horses, a mistake can be extremely costly to you, others and the
      horse.&nbsp; Experiences with horses can be talked about, they can be put
      in a book, they can be demonstrated by someone who knows, but experience
      cannot be taught and experience is the best teacher.&nbsp; Too often
      people want to learn how to train a horse, fix a problem, become a trainer
      or know everything about a horse from watching, reading and trying.&nbsp;
      It just does not work that way and the person and the horse ends up
      paying.<br />
      <br />
      For those who have kids, can you imagine asking a kid trainer how to raise
      your child so it will turn out good? You can raise five children and they
      all will turn out different.&nbsp; No one knows it all when it comes to
      raising kids and no one knows it all when it comes to training
      horses.&nbsp; Acknowledging that a horse is a strong, reactionary, fear
      driven, survival motivated, prey animal that has emotions, incredible
      strength and power and that no two are the same, is the first step to
      having a better understanding of the horse.&nbsp; With understanding comes
      confidence, power and the ability to recognize that you do not know it all
      and that a lot of horse training and handling depends on many factors not
      necessarily in your control.<br />
      <br />
      NOTE: The final product of raising a child is the parent. The final
      product of training a horse is you.<br />
      <br />
      Horse ownership is not a part-time gig.&nbsp; It is a serious commitment
      that requires time, patience, understanding, experience, knowledge and
      passion.&nbsp; Although horses love cookies, they are a lot different than
      cookies and require a lot more than simple directions and ingredients.<br />
      <br />
      With that said, is there an easy fast way to learn about horses?&nbsp; No,
      and many try and fail, many horses get hurt, many trainers make lots of
      money on videos, books, tricks, special ropes, special equipment and
      special games to play with your horse.&nbsp; Can some of this help?&nbsp;
      Yes.&nbsp; Does having a good trainer train your horse and make you
      better?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It may make you think you are better, it may make
      your horse better for the trainer, it may help you and your horse win a
      ribbon or money, but it will not make you a better horseman or
      horsewoman.<br />
      <br />
      In my opinion, two things make you successful and better with
      horses.&nbsp; The first is understanding and knowledge of the horse.&nbsp;
      The ability to �think like a horse�.&nbsp; Without this, you will continue
      to try to fix problems and never realize that each problem is nothing but
      a symptom of your lack of understanding of the horse.&nbsp; The second
      thing is time.&nbsp; Time will give you experience, time with horses will
      teach you to listen, observe and learn from the horse.&nbsp; Time will
      teach you the language of the horse.&nbsp; It will teach to trust and read
      the horse.&nbsp; It will teach you to observe and notice the slightest
      change in the horse and yourself.&nbsp; It will teach you that the horse
      is only a reflection of what you do and how you do it.&nbsp; Only then
      will you see the horse as the amazing creature it is.<br />
      <br />
      Therefore, it you are making cookies, follow the directions exactly.&nbsp;
      It you are working with horses, realize there is no secret recipe,
      shortcuts or easy fast experiences.&nbsp; Understanding and time will get
      you the best results and your horse will thank you for your efforts.&nbsp;
      In addition, in the end the more you know, will make you realize how much
      you do not know and then you will realize the journey of horsemanship is
      never ending.<br />
      <br />
      Happy trails,<br />

      <strong>Ride Time</strong><br />
      <br />
      Riding is the art of keeping a horse between you and the ground.&nbsp;
      This is done with some luck, a good seat, balance, good equipment and of
      course a good Horse (Is there any other kind?).&nbsp; I see riders fall
      off horses all the time and then hear later that the horse threw the
      person off.&nbsp; I guess saying you got thrown and blaming the horse is
      easier than saying, I lost my balance, I was not paying attention, I got
      too relaxed or just, it was my fault and I fell off.&nbsp; I used to hear
      expressions about, �Riding between the reins� and �Keeping the horse
      between your legs�, I used to think this was just some clever way that old
      good riders talked about riding.&nbsp; It was not, it was like many things
      with horses, that you do not really understand it until you experience
      it.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      I am by no means a perfect rider and there are many out there can make me
      look like a rookie.&nbsp; However, I can stay in a saddle, I can
      communicate to a horse, it is said I have a good seat and I have many
      hours of time in the saddle.&nbsp; Time in the saddle is key, in my
      opinion, to making you a good rider.&nbsp; If you are a weekend warrior,
      ride an hour every few days or just on the weekends, then it will take
      many many years for you to really learn to ride.&nbsp; Owning horses and
      riding horses is a lifestyle and not a hobby.&nbsp; Unless you fully
      engulf yourself into the equine, you will probably not ever get really
      good at horses or riding.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may ask, surely not everyone
      that wins awards and medals spend all their time with a horse or in a
      saddle.&nbsp; I would say most of them probably do, especially in their
      area of competition.&nbsp; If you want to circles good, you have to do a
      lot of circles. Can someone learn to ride and become good by just taking
      lessons?&nbsp; People can learn how the horse was trained, what cues were
      used to train it and then be taught to give those cues.&nbsp; In this
      case, the horse is carrying the rider.&nbsp; This person will not be able
      to fix issues, will not able to refine the horse�s movement, will not be
      helping the horse and may never truly understand what it takes from the
      horse to give them what they are getting.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Ride Time is the key.&nbsp; Some say that only perfect practice is
      beneficial.&nbsp; I say all practice and contact with horses helps you in
      some way.&nbsp; Even if you ride badly, spending time in the saddle
      helps.&nbsp; If you just sit in a saddle, it helps.&nbsp; Just getting on
      and off the saddle, helps you get better in the saddle.&nbsp; Any time you
      spend time in the saddle, you train your balance, you use muscles that
      increase your balance, you improve your balance, you gain confidence, you
      feel more comfortable in the saddle and all of this transforms into making
      you a better rider.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you fall off a horse, you get
      better!&nbsp; Yep, just like when you learn to ski, you fall a lot and
      each time you fall, you learn how not to repeat the thing that made you
      fall last time.&nbsp; Soon you are not falling as much.&nbsp; No
      difference in riding horses.&nbsp; Experience makes you better; the only
      way to get experience is to �DO IT�.&nbsp; You can get some help from a
      trainer, you can get lots of help from others that don�t know much and you
      can watch videos until your DVD wears out, but when it comes down to it,
      �Ride Time� is the best teacher.&nbsp; But Rick, I am busy, I have a life,
      I have kids, I have responsibilities, I just don�t have the time, bla,
      bla, bla, either you want it or you don�t.&nbsp; It is very frustrating to
      see people always looking for short cuts with horses, there are not any
      and every time a person tries, �the horse pays for it�.&nbsp; Spend time
      with your horse and spend time in the saddle, there is no better way to
      learn how to ride.<br />
      <br />
      With that said, I will try and give some tips that may help you understand
      riding a little bit better, but without doing this, practicing this and
      spending time in the saddle experiencing this, what I say is nothing more
      than some talk from me.&nbsp; When riding your horse, your goal is to be
      neutral.&nbsp; Neutral is �stay out of the way of the horse�.&nbsp; Ride
      and concentrate on staying out of the way, stay neutral in balance, do not
      lean, do not lean forward, do not lean back and do not lean to the
      sides.&nbsp; But Rick, I thought you were supposed to lean back when you
      stop.&nbsp; That is correct, when you want to send a cue to stop you lean
      back and or shift your weight back.&nbsp; Stopping is not riding.&nbsp;
      When riding, you stay neutral.&nbsp; If you cannot sit on a horse
      bareback, you do not have balance.&nbsp; If you need a mounting block to
      mount a horse you probably do not have good balance or strength.&nbsp; I
      do know some old cowboys that have gotten �long in the tooth� and their
      body is just not able to jump onto a saddle to mount, so they use a
      block.&nbsp; They still have balance from years of experience of riding,
      also know as �muscle memory.�&nbsp; The people I am referring to is the
      people that are overweight, unfit, lack coordination, do not exercise and
      have little or no leg muscles and then think they can ride.&nbsp; Riding
      takes balance and the ability to keep your balance while the thing (the
      horse) is moving under you.&nbsp; By being able to stay neutral in the
      saddle, you stay out of the horse�s way.&nbsp; You allow the horse to
      carry you with the least amount of effort.&nbsp; You make the horse�s job
      easier and you learn how he moves when you are not in the way.&nbsp; If
      you do not do this, you are so busy keeping your balance that you confuse
      the horse, make the horse work harder and make the horse uncomfortable
      when you are on him.&nbsp; So do not compensate for the horse, do not try
      to help the horse and do not interfere with the horse.&nbsp; Work on
      yourself and your horse will get better.&nbsp; If you do not learn how to
      stay out of the way of the horse, you will create future problems. Learn
      to be neutral, learn to stay out of the horse�s way and learn to be
      balanced in the saddle.&nbsp; You learn this by doing it! Ride time!<br />
      <br />
      The more you ride and the more horses you ride, the more you will be able
      to tell the difference between a horse that can carry himself well and it
      will help you carry yourself better.&nbsp; At the beginning, you will not
      know the difference.&nbsp; To be well carried by horse is a good
      feeling.&nbsp; To help a horse you must make yourself a good load and an
      easy load to carry.&nbsp; You cannot do this if you are pulling and using
      the reins for balance, if you are using the stirrups for balance, if you
      are hanging onto the saddle for balance.&nbsp; As you get better, you will
      learn to use all things a little and nothing alone!&nbsp; This is really
      important.&nbsp; The reins alone do not stop a horse, the bit does not
      stop a horse, your seat position does not stop a horse, your legs do not
      stop a horse, your voice commands do stop a horse, a fence does not stop a
      horse, and your whip does not stop a horse.&nbsp; Communication to the
      horse and the horse wanting to comply is what stops a horse.&nbsp; Some of
      these together may work, but in my experience if a horse wants to run more
      than he wants to stop, he will run.&nbsp; Not because he is mean, not
      because he is stubborn, not because he is a bad horse, he is just simply a
      horse and has not been taught to stop.&nbsp; Therefore, like balance, not
      one thing gives it to you.&nbsp; You should use the stirrups lightly, the
      saddle lightly, your leg muscles, you center of balance, you seat, your
      head, your shoulders, your back, your position of your arms (not your arms
      pulling on the reins), your knees acting like shock absorbers, your core
      strength, all of this will help give you better balance and help keep you
      neutral.&nbsp; Being neutral is NOT sitting like a lump on a log. Using
      all of these takes time to learn so it becomes natural, until it becomes
      unconscious, over time you will not have to think about it, it will just
      happen.&nbsp; However, to get you to that point, you need to �Do it�, you
      need to spend time in the saddle to learn it and practice it.&nbsp; You
      need �Ride time.�<br />
      <br />
      Anyone can stand around and yell �Keep your heels down�, �Sit up
      straight�, �Don�t look down�, �Relax your back�, �Use your legs�, �Look
      where you are going�, �Use your seat�, �Don�t lean�, �Keep your hands
      still�, �Stop pulling on the reins�, �Relax�, �Don�t bounce in the
      saddle�, �Move with your horse�, �Find your rhythm�, �Keep your hands
      soft�, �Get off the bit�, �Get on the bit�, �Stop picking at your horse�,
      �Feel your horse�s beat� and many other tips. If you are trying to think
      about this, you are not riding.&nbsp; Most will tell you that you should
      have a straight line from your ear, shoulder, hip and ankles.&nbsp; If you
      have to think about this, it is hard to make it happen, it will happen
      when you are not thinking about it, if you ride enough to feel it, to
      learn it, to feel how it does not feel right when you do not do it.&nbsp;
      All of these words may help, but you have to experience it to recognize
      the significance of it.&nbsp; You need to learn this by doing it.&nbsp;
      Ride time! The horse is best teacher of the horse.<br />
      <br />
      I mentioned shock absorbers earlier.&nbsp; This is muscles working and it
      takes training and strength.&nbsp; Your shoulders cannot help you stay in
      the saddle, per say.&nbsp; Your seat is made soft and secure by being
      relaxed and not tense.&nbsp; Your feet and ankles, your knees, and your
      legs and hips all working together can help reduce movement, control
      movement and absorb shock.&nbsp; By using your ankles, knees and hips, you
      control your bounce up and down, forward and back.&nbsp; You use these to
      stop some movement and then to create other movement (impulsion).&nbsp; By
      using these correctly you help the horse carry you and make yourself
      appear lighter and easier to carry and that helps you give good
      signals/cues to the horse.&nbsp; You use these to stop your shoulders and
      arms from bouncing up and down and all around.&nbsp; Just like a horse
      running on the wrong lead, it is hard on the horse, you bouncing in the
      saddle because you don�t know how to use your body and balance is hard on
      you and hard on the horse.&nbsp; By not using your shock absorbers
      correctly, you harden the jars and blows to the horse�s back and your
      back.&nbsp; The horse pays for his mistakes, pays for your mistakes, and
      then pays again when he is blamed for both.<br />
      <br />
      I hear lots of people tell people to use their legs.&nbsp; If you do not
      have balance, if you do not know how to control your reins softly, if you
      do not have much �ride time�, then trying to use your legs is just one
      more thing to confuse you and the horse.&nbsp; Legs help communicate with
      the horse, but it has to be done without throwing you off balance, without
      you getting confused and having to think about it.&nbsp; When you try to
      do too much, you make the situation worse and you confuse the horse.&nbsp;
      I cannot help a person round pen a horse if they do not know how to lead a
      horse.&nbsp; I cannot help a person use their legs if they do not have
      balance and rein control.&nbsp; I cannot teach rein control if the person
      who has not got balance down.&nbsp; Legs are additional cues to the horse,
      but if your horse is confused with your lack of balance and your lack of
      consistency of rein usage, confusing him more with legs will only make it
      worse.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      I say this a lot, 80% of all horse owners are women, and 75% of new horse
      owners get OUT of horses in the first year.&nbsp; New horse owners want to
      get a �baby� (a young untrained horse), want to teach it themselves, want
      to learn with the horse, all BAD!&nbsp; Green riders with green horses =
      hurt riders and people getting out of horses.&nbsp; It is a bad combo and
      no matter how much you tell someone this, they all know they are different
      and they can do it and they can make it work, it won�t happen to them, and
      they will be careful, they know the risk���.. �And they all get hurt and
      get out of horses and the horse gets blamed�.&nbsp; The statistics are out
      there, they grow every year and if you go to any clinic, you will see
      mostly bright-eyed women with their dream of owning and training their own
      horse coming true.&nbsp; Then go to any barn and you will women being
      dragged, thrown, with slings on, wearing helmets to keep them safe and
      riding with fear and insecurity.&nbsp; They will ride in enclosed areas
      where it is safe and making their horse arena sour, barn sour, or other
      names they want to pin on a horse.&nbsp; This is done by men too, it is
      just now the horse world is predominately women.&nbsp; Had I been writing
      this 25 years ago about, I would be talking about men beating and abusing
      horses to get them to listen and blaming the horse and when they got hurt
      I would be saying good for the horse.&nbsp; When someone gets hurt trying,
      it is sad and unfortunate, but when someone gets hurt being brutal to a
      horse, I say, good for the horse.<br />
      <br />
      I love horses, but they are very �DANGEROUS� in the wrong hands.&nbsp; Do
      not underestimate the gravity of this statement.&nbsp; A horse will kill
      themselves if they are scared and trapped or think they can get
      away.&nbsp; It is their nature.&nbsp; So people want to wear a plastic
      helmet and feel safe.&nbsp; A helmet will not stop your neck or back from
      getting broke.&nbsp; It will not stop you from breaking a hip or
      leg.&nbsp; It will not help keep you in the saddle or stop your from being
      dragged with a foot in the stirrup when you fall off.&nbsp; A helmet gives
      a false since of security and causes people to do things they would not
      normally do without a helmet, because they FEEL safe.&nbsp; This is bad
      when it comes to horses.&nbsp; A horse does not care if your head is
      protected or if you ride him in a Styrofoam body suit.&nbsp; If he gets
      nervous, scared or feels you are not in control and you are putting his
      safety in jeopardy, he will take charge and react.&nbsp; Moreover, when he
      does it, it will be with extreme force and strength and you and your
      safety will be of no consideration to him.&nbsp; But Rick, I have heard
      lots of stories where a horse has saved a person and protected a fallen
      rider.&nbsp; It is the rare exception and people want to see things in
      their own way and it may be different from what actually happened.&nbsp; I
      can bring a horse a carrot and hay every day and the horse will be happy
      to see me and allow me to feed him, but let me try and get this horse to
      move or put this horse in a fear situation and I assure you, the last
      thing in this horse�s mind is that I have given him carrots and
      feed.&nbsp; As the horse threw his rider into a tree or barbed wire fence,
      the rider thinks, �why would you do this, I treat you so good�, the horse
      thinks �I can run faster and save myself now with less weight�.<br />
      <br />
      So why do I talk about dangerous horses when I am talking about
      riding.&nbsp; They are so connected it is not responsible to talk about
      one without the other.&nbsp; Riding a horse is dangerous, this is why it
      is probably so fulfilling and gives such a joy and a since of
      wholeness.&nbsp; Joining with a horse is something special.&nbsp; It is
      risky and does not come cheap or without time and sacrifice.&nbsp; The
      problem is being human; we want things now, fast and without
      sacrifice.&nbsp; Well, I think you can either sacrifice now and learn to
      ride and understand the horse, or you can sacrifice later and get hurt,
      maimed or killed by taking short cuts.&nbsp; If you take the time it
      takes, it takes less time.&nbsp; The slow way is the fast way with
      horses.&nbsp; Ride time is the best teacher for learning to ride and the
      horse is best teacher of the horse.<br />
      <br />
      If I said it once, I say it a thousand times, ride your horse, spend time
      with your horse and learn about the horse.&nbsp; Knowledge about the horse
      is the best gift you can give to your horse, second only to time.&nbsp; If
      you spend enough time, knowledge will come and the horse will teach
      you.<br />
      <br />
      Happy trails,<br />

      <strong>Picking a Horse Trainer - Tricks of the Trade</strong><br />
      <br />
      I have wanted to do an article on this for some time now. It is too bad,
      but it seems there are so many shysters, unethical horse trainers and just
      plain old rip off specialist out there in the horse world. I see many more
      horse traders that pass themselves off as trainers, than I see good honest
      horse people that truly have the horse�s best interest in mind. Since the
      beginning of man, it seems people have always found ways to use the horse
      to make money. Not much as changed over the years.<br />
      <br />
      I worked with a horse the other day that was sent off to a trainer for
      seven months of "training". Let me say that again, seven months with a so
      called professional trainer. After seven months of training, this horse
      would not let you catch it, could not be lead, could not lunge, could not
      be tied and was fearful of every thing. This is just a shame for the horse
      and owner. The owner paid good money for help and thought she was getting
      her horse trained for seven months. This so-called trainer was leading the
      horse around by tying it to a quad and dragging it, this was her idea of
      teaching the horse to lead. Did I mention that this horse did not have his
      feet trimmed for the seven months it was at training? Why? - they could
      not get the horse to hold up his feet for the Farrier. If I said it once,
      I have said it a hundred times, just because someone calls himself or
      herself a trainer, it does not make it so. When talking to the owner of
      this horse, I was told that when she wanted to go watch her horse and
      visit, the �trainer� told her she had to call first before coming out.
      This is a big red flag. I will list a few red flags you should watch for
      when picking a trainer.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <center>
      &nbsp;
      <p align="justify">
        Red Flags to watch for from �Trainers�:<br />
        <br />
        � If you are told to call before you come to visit<br />
        <br />
        � �I train at varied hours, so I can�t give you a specific time I work
        with your horse�<br />
        <br />
        � �I always wear spurs on my boots, but I don�t use them�<br />
        <br />
        � �I don�t like or buy into that �natural horsemanship� crap�<br />
        <br />
        � �I don�t want you and anyone else working with the horse while I am
        training it�<br />
        <br />
        � �I need to have time alone with your horse�<br />
        <br />
        � �I need a minimum of 60 or 90 days to fix this horse�<br />
        <br />
        � The trainer never ask what you plan to use the horse for<br />
        <br />
        � The trainer tells you what he is going to do and will not modify for
        your needs<br />
        <br />
        � The trainer can�t handle your horse any better than you can, on the
        first day<br />
        <br />
        � The trainer has over seven or eight horses in training (no time to
        work that many horse daily)
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    Your trainer should tell you, and if not you need to ask, what will my horse
    be able to do when you are done. If you get some mumbo jumbo about it
    depends on the horse, some horses learn faster, I do not like to rush the
    horse or my favorite, they get offended and tell you that you will get your
    30 days of training then we will where the horse is after that. If this
    trainer is reputable, honest and trust worthy, they will tell you a list of
    things you can expect and if it takes longer then they will not charge you
    for the additional time. Your trainer should tell you your horse would be
    able to do one, two and three when you get it back.&nbsp; Be aware of the
    trainers that just give lessons and you never see them on a horse. This is
    big Red Flag.&nbsp; This is more popular in the English area, but far too
    often, I see people charging good money for lessons that last years and
    there is little improvement.&nbsp; Many use trainers as high priced baby
    sitters.&nbsp; Parents just pay to have someone supervise their child on a
    horse and call it a lesson.&nbsp; If&nbsp;your trainers cannot demonstrate
    how to ride or how to do get the horse to do something, then they are not
    much a trainer.&nbsp; It does not take much skill to just sit back and yell
    "keep your heels down", "sit up straight", "don't look down", all of this
    sounds like riding lessons but is nothing more than lots of people repeating
    what others have said over the years.&nbsp; A good responsible trainer
    should be able to get on any horse and make that horse look better than
    you.&nbsp; There are some common excuses out there, that many trainers like
    to use, like I cannot ride anymore due to an injury, or I am too old to get
    on this horse and show you, and many others.&nbsp; I know one trainer that
    has been teaching at a local barn for the past 10 years, I have never seen
    her on a horse in all that time, yet she has no shortage of parents that pay
    her to teach their kids to ride. Many people think, I do not know anything
    about horses so I will pay someone. That is a big mistake. It would be like
    getting medical advice from a butcher since he wears a white coat like a
    doctor.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;
    <center>
      Things you need to make sure and tell your trainer before you hire or pay
      them.<br />
      <br />
      � I need to know when you work with my horse so I can watch, be there and
      ask questions<br />
      <br />
      � I need to have full access to my horse while in training<br />
      <br />
      � I don�t want spurs worn or used when I horse is in training<br />
      <br />
      � I don�t� want any bits other than a snaffle (or bit that you intent to
      ride) used on my horse<br />
      <br />
      � I don�t want a stud chain used on my horse<br />
      <br />
      � I don�t want my horse dragged or led by any vehicles<br />
      <br />
      � I want my horse to be able to do 1, 2 and 3 when I get it back<br />
      <br />
      � I would like weekly or bi-weekly demonstrations on what my horse has
      learned or improved in<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;
    </center>
    <p align="justify">
      A good litmus test when picking a trainer is does this trainer own horses?
      Can you ride his/her horses? If these answers are no, I would not think
      this person is much of a trainer for you. You would not take your car to
      an unlicensed person, who works in an alley, that does not own any cars
      and then he tells you he only takes cash and you cannot watch him work on
      your car. I would call this a �clue�. If your trainer cannot immediately
      handle your horse better than you can, then I would be suspicious. A good
      horse person can make a horse look worse and more difficult to try to
      convince that you need to hire them, so be aware. I have a video on this
      on Youtube called "horse trainer tricks".<br />
      <br />
      You need to get weekly updates from you trainer. Like a report card, what
      your horse has learned, what issues your horse has, what are the strengths
      and weaknesses of your horse and any injuries or problems? Just because
      you give your horse to a trainer, you are still responsible for its care.
      You should checking if the horse has clear fresh water, what it is being
      fed, is the feet being trimmed, etc.<br />
      <br />
      If your horse is sent away to another location, you need to ensure shots
      and hoof care are kept up to date and your schedule is followed. Have
      goals defined on what you want from your horse. I want to lead him, ride
      him on trails, have my inexperienced child ride him and be able to pick up
      his feet. If you want these things and your trainer trains your horse to
      slide stop and spin in an arena but will not work for you. If I want to
      trail ride my horse, I do not want a trainer that only works my horse in a
      round pen or in an enclosed arena. If I want to ride dressage, I do not
      want some cow cutting horse trainer training my horse on cows. A good
      trainer should be asking these questions so they know what and how to
      train your horse.<br />
      <br />
      You have to be actively involved with your trainer and training. You have
      to know how your horse is being taught, what aids are being used, what leg
      pressure is being used, how are the reins being used and just general
      handling of your horse. You need to be able to see how your horse handles
      pressure, how it deals with fear and too much pressure. By being involved
      you can ask questions and work on YOUR horsemanship and horse knowledge,
      so you will be able to continue teaching and growing with your horse.
      There is no such thing as a trained horse. I can screw up a horse is a few
      days that was trained.<br />
      <br />
      If a trainer is good and honest, he or she will have no problem with any
      of these requests. They should be encouraging you to be involved and if
      they are really interested in helping the horse, they will end your
      horse�s training with a few days or week of training you and your horse
      together. That way you can get immediate feedback on what you are doing
      wrong or why your horse is doing what it does with you. A trained horse in
      the hands of an untrained rider is like giving a car to teenager with no
      license and no driving experience. The car will be fine and knows what to
      do, but the danger is with the driver. Not a lot of difference with
      horses. Any good trainer will know this and will not try to sell you on
      how good a trainer he is or on how good he can make your horse look when
      he rides it. Any good rider can make a horse look good or better than an
      inexperienced rider. That is a cheap trainers trick. Much like me making a
      horse rear or pull to make you think your horse is hard to handle and
      needs a professional.<br />
      <br />
      A good little trick that some trainers like to do is tell you how bad your
      horse is and how it may take longer since your horse is so bad. BS is what
      this is. Any real trainer knows that a horse can be fixed as easy as it
      can be messed up, with few exceptions. Any person who knows horses will
      know how to make your horse look worse than it is, cause it to pull, rear,
      or act out and then convince you that this horse is really difficult. This
      is nothing more than a set up for extending the horse�s training and
      dragging out the training so you feel you have to keep the horse in
      training longer. Taking advantage of an inexperience horse person is not
      hard. It is really very easy for any horse person to do. It is wrong,
      unethical and bad for the horse. By taking advantage of inexperienced
      owners, these trainers set the owner up to get hurt and set the horse up
      to get blamed. Inexperienced horse owners be warned!<br />
      <br />
      I hear a lot of people who are fearful of their Farriers, Vet and
      trainers. They are concerned about upsetting them by asking questions,
      giving instructions or making demands. You pay these people for a service
      and have a right to request things from them. If anyone of them wants to
      get upset about your request, then they should be able to explain why they
      cannot do something and why they think it is a bad idea. Do not let people
      you pay for a service dictate how they treat your horse? With that said,
      you have to be involved in helping your horse. If you expect your Farrier
      to teach and train your horse to hold his feet up, that will not work. If
      you expect your Vet to teach you how to control your horse safely while
      getting medical attention, that won�t work.<br />
      <br />
      So do your homework, pick a trainer with caution and skepticism. Ask lots
      of questions, stay involved and make some clear goals. If at any time, the
      hair on the back of your neck stands up, pay attention to this clue. Ask
      another trainer, do some research on the internet, get a second opinion
      and confirm things for yourself. Do not take anything as gospel, just
      because this person calls himself a �Trainer�. I know another lady that
      called six different trainers crying because she could not catch her
      horse. Finally when the six trainer said they train her horse, she jumped
      on the offer since the first five told her no. Not a good choice for her
      or her horse.<br />
      <br />
      Remember the first rule of horse ownership "Never believe anything someone
      tells you about a horse". Don't forget to make sure what and how your
      horse is fed, if you leave good hay, there is no way for you to know if
      that is being fed to your horse, so a sudden weight loss is a clue. If a
      "trainer" tells you the horse has lost weight due to how much it is being
      worked, another old trainer trick, what normally is happening is your
      horse is being fed substandard hay, not being fed or starved so it will
      not have the energy to fight or resist. I know many trainers that if you
      bring high quality expensive hay and drop it off, they will keep your hay
      and feed their cheaper low quality hay. How will you know?&nbsp; Your
      horse - your responsibility.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck and Happy Trails,<br />
      <br />

      Scientific studies show there is no place in horse sports for tight
      nosebands and unstable �galloping positions.<br />
      <br />
      There is not much to like about this photo. You would have a hard time
      getting the recommended two fingers under the straps. When this poor,
      unfortunate horse�s noseband is finally loosened, you will see grooves cut
      into his sinus cavities by the overtightened noseband. His open mouth and
      the tension of the reins tell us he is not in self-carriage. Strapping
      your horse�s mouth shut usually produces the sort of deadened response we
      see here.<br />
      <br />
      If you are a horseman, chances are you are extremely conservative. I do
      not mean this in the political sense of liberal and conservative, but in
      the literal sense that you are disposed to preserve existing conditions.
      You have very good reasons for this conservatism when it comes to the
      welfare of your horse. The penalties for change without contemplation can
      be severe, and your horse pays the penalty with his health and soundness
      if you are wrong. If wisdom is the anticipation of consequence, then we
      all labor to be wise when it comes to our horses, �because they trust us
      so completely with their well-being.<br />
      <br />
      Looking back over my career, I find I have always been resistant to fads
      and changes in the horse world. Some fads, �especially when it comes to
      apparel, do little harm to our horses, although bling says something about
      the rider�s need for attention rather than the attention she should pay to
      her horse. Other fads are more abusive (rollkur comes to mind) and some,
      like the now outmoded use of a true interval system of conditioning (short
      bursts of maximum exertion), injure horses with sickening regularity.
      Unlike humans, horses do not self-monitor their own soundness. If you ask
      a good horse to gallop until he is exhausted, he will cheerfully injure
      himself for you. Modern eventers may speak of using an interval system to
      condition their horses, but what they really mean is they use an
      intermittent system of exercise and conditioning.<br />
      <br />
      Although conservatism has its benefits, we must always be open to
      improvement in the care and training of our horses, �especially when that
      change is supported by scientific research. I am speaking of two topics I
      have discussed previously: the use and abuse of tight nosebands in
      dressage and the unsafe and unsteady galloping �position that has crept
      into our teaching.<br />
      <br />
      One Noseband for All?<br />
      <br />
      Nosebands are one of my many irritants when coaching. For example, flash
      nosebands are ubiquitous in the eventing world. Almost every horse I see
      is wearing one. Flash nosebands are inherently ill fitting�a flash is
      basically an inefficient figure-eight noseband�so they are invariably
      overtightened, causing a pronounced indentation in the flesh of the nasal
      bone and, occasionally, small sores on the lips. In addition, these
      nosebands can interfere with the horse�s normal swallowing mechanism,
      producing the very resistance they are intended to cure.<br />
      <br />
      I can�t decide which irritates me more: overtightened nosebands or the
      mindless application of equipment, regardless of whether it is suitable
      for this horse at this stage of training. Not every horse in the eventing
      world needs or goes well in a flash noseband. Yet when I ask riders
      whether they have tried other nosebands, or even no noseband, they look at
      me as if I had just stepped down the ramp of the mother ship. Obviously,
      it has never �occurred to them to try something else. �After all,
      everybody tacks up their horses this way, so it must be correct. Sigh.<br />
      <br />
      In the past, I have spoken out against the use of overly tight nosebands
      on pragmatic rather than scientific grounds. My reasoning was that both
      the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) and U.S. Equestrian
      Federation rules consider it a good sign when a horse softly chews the
      bit, and judges reward this behavior during the dressage test with
      favorable marks. A good working definition of classical training is that
      we do not ask the horse to do anything he does not do in nature. Clearly,
      strapping a horse�s mouth shut is unnatural and will not produce classical
      results in terms of acceptance of the bit, softness of contact or
      self-carriage. Naturally, we want the best possible score for our horses,
      but by cranking the noseband as tight as possible, we actually prevent
      them from accepting the bit correctly.<br />
      <br />
      Given all this, you can understand that a recent series of articles at
      www.eurodressage.com got my attention and led me to scientific studies
      regarding the effect of tight nosebands on equines. The researchers�
      findings�that tight nosebands are abusive to horses�are not surprising.
      However, new scientific knowledge means that we now can prove something
      that was merely alleged in the past.<br />
      <br />
      If our current practices are proven to be abusive, even unintentionally,
      then we must immediately adopt new practices based on the latest findings.
      What surprises me is that this is not happening: Riders and trainers are
      not changing their practices in response to new information. We do things
      a certain way because we have always done them this way and it is too much
      trouble to learn new techniques. This attitude is prevalent in the horse
      world and is a huge barrier to improving the health and training of our
      horses.<br />
      <br />
      Still Galloping �Inefficiently<br />
      <br />
      William Fox-Pitt gallops the same way he does everything else in the
      saddle�he is technically close to perfect. His stirrup leathers are
      vertical, which allows his stirrups to support his weight. His ankles and
      knees are flexed and obviously acting as shock absorbers. The stability of
      his lower leg, even at speed, is the reason his elbows can follow the
      oscillation of his horse�s head and neck correctly. Although I like to see
      a rider gallop with a slight arch in the small of his back (a slight arch
      conforms to the natural shape of the human spine), William is so tall that
      he can be forgiven the lowering of his shoulders and slight rounding of
      his lower back. Taller riders tend to do this because it brings the center
      of gravity closer to their horses. Note that William is supported by the
      spring of his knees. He is not standing straight-legged, which would drive
      his weight down into Parklane Hawk�s withers with every stride. His reins
      are adjusted correctly, not bridged against his horse�s neck. This allows
      his arm and shoulder to function as a spring and a pivot. William has
      discovered that form follows function, which explains why he always looks
      so stylish in the saddle. His mechanics are so sound that he can
      concentrate on getting the best from each of his horses.<br />
      <br />
      In the same vein as the continuing abusive use of nosebands, eventers are
      still being taught an inefficient and unstable galloping position�long
      after the Royal Veterinary College in London (in conjunction with the
      British Racing School) determined that the most efficient, scientifically
      correct galloping position is very different from the one many eventing
      instructors teach.<br />
      <br />
      This puzzles me on several levels. First, the various associations and
      organizations involved in the operation and advancement of eventing
      exhibit a distinct lack of curiosity about the fundamentals and mechanics
      of our sport. In addition, instructors seem to have scant critical faculty
      when it comes to the mechanical principles they pass on to their students.
      They seem content to repeat something they heard along the way.<br />
      <br />
      We need a continued re-examination of our basic principles with an eye
      toward adjustment and improvement, especially when those changes and
      alterations are based on scientific research. Sadly, this is not the case.
      At present, too many eventers are standing straight-legged above their
      horses, resting their body weight on bridges against their horses� necks
      and galloping like lemmings toward the cliff. This lack of both curiosity
      and a desire to improve is a disservice to our sport. The standing
      position at the gallop has the potential to damage eventing as much as the
      crest release did to the hunter/jumper world, which created generations of
      riders unable to maintain a connection with their horses� mouths. If we do
      not learn from others� mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them.<br />
      <br />
      While watching the Rolex Kentucky Three-Day Event last spring, it was
      clear to me that many riders� problems with the course were caused by
      woefully incorrect galloping positions. Four-star horses are exuberant by
      nature, and once we get them completely fit, they take an attitude toward
      speed and fixed obstacles that is not for everyone. Time after time,
      riders came into view standing straight up in their stirrups. Because
      their horses were galloping so aggressively, they usually leaned back on
      the reins in a vain attempt to slow down and set up for a serious
      combination.<br />
      <br />
      When a rider stands straight up and pulls on the reins, his horse will
      usually invert his shape, with his head high and his back low and locked.
      This shape in the approach to a fence is almost guaranteed to produce
      trouble, and the Rolex riders who used this technique were very
      susceptible to error. When you contrast this with the position that
      cross-country stylists such as Great Britain�s William Fox-Pitt and New
      Zealand�s Andrew Nicholson use, the differences are stark. It is
      interesting how good results always seem to follow sound fundamentals.<br />
      <br />
      Based on scientific findings, then, many of our U.S. riders� fundamentals
      are flawed in terms of galloping and jumping across country. Obviously, we
      need some serious study and remedial action. Possibly it is time for the
      USEF and the U.S. Eventing Association to join some kind of partnership
      with organizations such as the Chris McCarron North American Racing
      Academy or the British Racing School. In their field, these two
      organizations have the same credibility as our dressage and show-jumping
      gurus, and we should avail ourselves of their expertise.<br />
      <br />
      I understand there are coaches and theoreticians around the country who
      disagree with me, but to date their opinions are just that�opinions rather
      than scientific evidence. Until further studies prove that standing in the
      stirrups is the most efficient way to gallop, I will continue to teach
      according to current findings.<br />
      <br />
      In closing, it puzzles me how little study and time eventers put into the
      cross-country part of their sport. Riders cheerfully spend six months in a
      dressage barn learning to sit the trot. They will leap at the chance to
      work for show-jumping trainers to improve their timing and ring-craft in
      that discipline. Yet, when it comes to in-depth study about riding at
      speed over fixed obstacles, nothing happens.<br />
      <br />
      It would make sense for these riders to become involved with a
      steeplechase barn. There they could learn to gallop correctly, restrain
      their horses using �leverage rather than sharp bits and gain a sense of
      pace that will make their speeds around the Rolex cross-country course
      seem like a walk in the park.<br />
      <br />
      While eventing is a risk sport, we must make every effort to control that
      risk with expertise. Repeating our mistakes with an expectation of
      �improvement is a good definition of �insanity. People outside of our
      sport have �remarked that they think we are crazy to go cross-country.
      Let�s not prove them right. It�s time for a change.<br />

      <strong>Release, Timing and Feel - The Big Three</strong><br />
      <br />
      Wow, talk about big topics.&nbsp; I call this "The Big Three�.&nbsp; These
      are sometime mystical terms that are used often and most people never
      really understand them, never know their importance or never experience
      them.&nbsp; These things come from "Time".&nbsp; Time handling horses,
      time working horses, time riding horses, time watching horses, time making
      mistakes, time seeing others do it right, time seeing others do it wrong,
      time listening to the horse and time reflecting on all of this. "If you
      take the time it takes - it takes less time.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Many of my videos on Youtube explain this in more detail:&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Sounds like double talk.&nbsp; Sounds like old horse whisperer
      stuff.&nbsp; Are these things really real or is it something that old
      timer�s just talk about to intrigue others.&nbsp; Let�s talk about each
      one of these since I think they are all connected and all affect each
      other.&nbsp; So I will try and discuss them individually.<br />
      <br />
      -- Release: Anyone can pull or yank a horse, but it takes someone who
      understands how to release, and how to release with timing and feel to
      really get results.&nbsp; Release is that exact moment where learning
      takes place in the horse.&nbsp; The second a horse gets release, he
      connects that release to the right answer.&nbsp; So if a horse is
      pressured by a person and it rears and as soon as it rears, it scares the
      person putting on the pressure, so the person backs away in fear of their
      safety, the horse sees this as release.&nbsp; So the person gives release,
      but with bad timing.&nbsp; The horse does not know this, it only knows, it
      got release when it reared, so rearing gets him release, therefore,
      rearing must be the right answer.&nbsp; This is an example of bad release
      but since release teaches, the horse always sees release as good.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Good release teaches the right thing.&nbsp; So if a person tries to get a
      horse to back up and puts pressure to back up and as soon as the horse
      takes one step back, the person releases, and then the horse learns that
      backing up is the right answer.&nbsp; If the person stops pressure when
      the horse turns away, rears, or tries to bite them, then the horse thinks
      and learns that is the right answer.&nbsp; So knowing release only works
      if the person knows how and when to release pressure.&nbsp; Almost
      everything a horse learns is by pressure and release. An example of a
      horse learning something without pressure and release is more "classical
      conditioning".&nbsp; You break a carrot in half, the horse hears this,
      knows what this is and comes over to get the carrot and you give the
      carrot to the horse.&nbsp; However, this could be seen by the horse as
      pressure and release if you are not careful.&nbsp; If done wrong, the
      horse can see him coming over to you as putting pressure on you and then
      you giving the carrot is release from his pressure on you.&nbsp;
      Everything with a horse is how they see it.&nbsp; This is a Key
      Point....&nbsp; it does not matter what you intended to do, what you do or
      what you think you did, it only matters how the horse sees it.&nbsp; Too
      often I see people teaching things they do not know they are teaching and
      then wonder why the horse does it. I have a couple of videos that explain
      Classical conditioning on Youtube:&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      So understanding release is very important so you can know what you are
      teaching, when you are teaching it and when you did it wrong.&nbsp; And
      remember, once you understand release, if you do it with bad feel and
      timing, it means nothing and you will be teaching something you did not
      intend to teach.&nbsp; Confused yet?&nbsp; We are just getting started.<br />
      <br />
      -- Timing: Sounds like a clock thing; if you can tell time you can have
      timing?&nbsp; If you can hit a baseball, drive a car or play any sport you
      should have some sort of timing.&nbsp; So having timing with a horse
      should not be that difficult.&nbsp; Well, timing could be a horse book in
      itself.&nbsp; Timing comes from doing wrong, experience (good and bad) and
      many other lessons from many horses.&nbsp; Pull on a horse at the wrong
      time and you get a fight, pull too early and you create the horse to pull,
      pull too late and you get behind the advantage point and you are dragged
      or get the rope pulled out of your hands.&nbsp; Of course pulling requires
      release, so if you time it right and do not release right, you blow
      it.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      On the other hand, if you have timing, you can get a horse to do things
      twice as fast, twice as easy and twice as good.&nbsp; Wow, this sounds
      pretty important, why are so many people so confused about it?&nbsp; It
      takes time and practice to learn it, develop it, perfect it and refine
      it.&nbsp; Every horse requires it to be done differently, maybe just a
      little, but each horse responds to timing with different feel.&nbsp; So
      having good timing with bad feel does not work, having good timing with
      bad release, does not work.&nbsp; All three are required, all three have
      to be constantly adjusted and all three need to be refined depending on
      what the horse does and how the horse responds.<br />
      <br />
      -- Feel:&nbsp; This is putting timing and release together with constant
      adjustments.&nbsp; So, lets look at this like kissing a girl (girls apply
      this to guys), a kiss is a kiss right?&nbsp; Kiss your wife good morning
      is different than kissing her goodbye, sometime.&nbsp; Kissing her after
      not seeing her for a month is different than kissing her after a hard day
      of work.&nbsp; Kissing her after giving birth to your child is different
      than kissing her for getting you socks for your birthday.&nbsp; Kissing
      her after she is in a car wreck is different than kissing her after you
      broke her favorite silly glass thingy collection special piece.&nbsp;
      Kissing her after you say "I do" is different than after she says "No you
      can't".&nbsp; And lastly kissing her after or during that special private
      time is also very different.&nbsp; Therefore, if someone said how many
      ways can you kiss, your first response may be a kiss is a kiss, but if you
      think about it and break it down, very little changes in timing and
      situation changes the feel and way you kiss.&nbsp; Of course, I kiss my
      horse differently than I kiss my girl.&nbsp; :)<br />
      <br />
      So just applying feel to a kiss you can see it has many variables.&nbsp;
      Now lets apply feel to how you handle a rope, how you put on a head stall,
      how you catch a horse, how you saddle a&nbsp; horse, how you pick a
      horse's feet, how you handle a horse in general, how you ride a horse, how
      you handle the reins, how you move towards a horse (pressure), how you
      move away from a horse (release), how you look at a horse, how your body
      is used to influence a horse and understanding a horse can feel and shake
      a fly off his hip.&nbsp; If you are thinking how can anyone know all this,
      welcome to the world of horsemanship.&nbsp; No matter how long you do it,
      you are always learning from each and every horse.&nbsp; You never know it
      all and the journey is never-ending. There is never one right answer since
      every situation is different, every horse is different and every
      experience is different.<br />
      <br />
      Then how can anyone claim to teach this?&nbsp; I have not seen too many
      that try to teach feel.&nbsp; Tough subject and not easy to learn, but the
      horse can teach it.&nbsp; This would explain why so many people have so
      called "problem horses".&nbsp; You may hear things like, soft hands make
      soft horses.&nbsp; You cannot pull a horse to softness, but if you do not
      know timing and release, feel will not matter.<br />
      <br />
      I mentioned handling the reins earlier. Feel is so important in this
      area.&nbsp; Too rough, too loud, too soft, too easy or inconsistent will
      all result in confusion and frustration to the horse.&nbsp; When a horse
      is confused for too long it will stop trying to learn and stop searching
      for the right answer.&nbsp; This is when your training becomes harassment.
      Then they look at all these conflicting cues as picking or harassment and
      then they can become upset or they feel (different kind of feel) that
      there is no right answer and they can't find release so they go into fight
      mode if they cannot flee.&nbsp; So feel on the reins can be very helpful
      or can teach bad lessons.&nbsp; Being soft at the right time, firm at the
      right time and consistent will teach a horse how to be soft.&nbsp; But all
      this needs to be with timing and release.<br />
      <br />
      Let�s see if I can tie these together now.&nbsp; A good example of using
      all three of these would be catching a horse.&nbsp; How many times do I
      hear the same old story, "my horse won't let me catch him", "my horse is
      hard to catch", "my horse just runs away when I try and catch him", and my
      first answer to this is "STOP trying to catch him".&nbsp; I have a few
      videos on this topic on my Youtube channel:<br />
      <br />
      In order to catch a horse you need release, timing and feel.&nbsp; You
      need to know how to release pressure when the horse looks at you or faces
      you and tries to communicate with you.&nbsp; You need to release this
      pressure with timing so the horse connects the release with the looking or
      facing you.&nbsp; You need feel to read the horse on how to put just
      enough pressure to create movement and just enough release to create draw
      or stop movement.&nbsp; So when catching a hard to catch horse, a person
      with understanding of release, timing and feel can catch most any
      horse.&nbsp; A very common complaint is how do I catch my horse, this
      tells me, that people that ask this, do not have a clue about these big
      three.&nbsp; Can I teach you this?&nbsp; Can anyone teach you this?&nbsp;
      My answer is the best teacher of the big three is the Horse.&nbsp; Listen,
      watch, and learn from the horse and stop trying to teach, train and
      improve the horse.&nbsp; Always remembering, "The best teacher of the
      horse - is the horse."<br />

      <strong>Understanding Horse Fear</strong><br />
      <br />
      I still see far too many people blaming a horse for their instinctive fear
      responses. If you think like a horse and see the world as they do, it will
      help you understand them better and enable you to help them. Imagine if
      you were put in a cage with lions, bears and tigers roaming free. You know
      these animals will eat and kill you, but the only place that was safe and
      could protect you was a steel cage in the middle of all these people
      eating animals. Would you want to leave this protected cage? If you had to
      get to this cage, past an open area, can you image the fear you would feel
      as you ran to the cage trying to beat the many predators around you? Once
      in this protected cage would you be willing to come out? If someone tied a
      rope around your neck and pulled you out of this cage past the watching
      lions, tigers and bears, can even begin to think of the fear you would be
      experiencing? Welcome to the world of a horse.<br />
      <br />
      The other night I was out in pasture with my horses. It was about 10 PM, a
      beautiful night with a little rain falling lightly. I decided to bring a
      flake of hay out to the back of the pasture and let my guys eat in the
      open pasture, next to the side of a hill. It was quiet and I was enjoying
      listening to the horses eat and chew in the calm night. It was very
      peaceful and relaxing. Then in a second, everything changed. As I stood in
      between my two horses, rubbing them both on their backs, I saw a shadow
      appear on the hill. I was looking at the stars and my horses were both
      relaxed, head down and eating some good mixed grass hay. As I saw this
      shadow, I could not make out what it was, but I knew I saw movement. I
      also thought that me and my horses were the only ones in the pasture, so I
      thought. I became more focused on the area where I saw something. I forgot
      about my horses soothing chewing noise and I was not relaxed anymore. My
      heart rate went up and I was straining, or focusing to hear and see what I
      could not.&nbsp; I was transferring to my "flight or flight"
      instinct.&nbsp; Blood stopped flowing to my fingers and toes and moved to
      large muscles in my arms and legs, my heart rate raised, my instincts
      became more refined, so I could fight or run.&nbsp; Still searching for
      what I saw, then suddenly I found it. It was a coyote. A very large, not
      skinny and very healthy well-fed coyote. My first thought was �Holy shit,
      it�s a coyote.� As I watched him, he watched us. Hearing coyotes howling
      in the night is not uncommon and there are several packs in the area.
      However, they normally avoid humans and big horses, so all this was also
      running through my mind.<br />
      <br />
      After my initial, "this ain�t good" reaction, I started thinking. I
      thought my horses had not seen this guy yet and when they do, I might be
      screwed since I am in the middle of them. Self-survival was kicking in. I
      knew my horses could take this coyote out with one kick, strike or bite,
      but I did not want to be collateral damage in the middle of their
      reactions or survival. Therefore, I slowly and calmly stepped back and
      moved away from their charge or escape path, as to not be trampled in the
      reaction, I was sure was about to happen. As I moved, I kept my eyes on
      the coyote and he kept his eyes on me. Did I mention that this coyote was
      only about 10 yards away during this natural encounter? It was very close
      and unnatural.<br />
      <br />
      So after I got to a position where I felt safer (not safe), I started
      wondering why the horses have not spotted this guy yet. Surely if I saw
      it, my horse�s keener sense of smell vision and hearing should have
      enabled them to see it? I was confused. I checked the wind direction to
      see if the coyote�s scent was being blown towards the horses or away from
      them. Oddly enough, it appeared as it if was being blown towards them. So
      now I not thinking completely calm but I am wondering if my horses are
      idiots, are they too engrossed in the good hay to be paying attention or
      are they so domesticated that they did not realize the danger I was
      seeing. So now, about 15 seconds have passed and it seemed a lot longer,
      yet no reaction from my horses, not even a head raise. I am thoroughly
      confused now. How can these horses, perfectly designed for survival, not
      see this clear and present threat, which I saw over a half of a minute
      ago?<br />
      <br />
      As I watched this strange occurrence develop, the coyote decided to get a
      better look at us and he came a step or two closer, down the hill and
      towards us. I am thinking, this coyote must be crazy, he sure is bold,
      maybe he has friends and something bad is about to happen. Then, to my
      amazement, my Mustang (Mr. T ) calmly and deliberately lifted his head
      half way, faced the predator, pinned his ears, gave a slight nod and gave
      that �don�t come any closer look�. To my surprise, the coyote seemed to
      understand the message. The coyote stopped immediately in his tracks,
      turned away and went back up the hill. I was in shock, here I was,
      second-guessing these marvelous creatures and the entire time, they knew
      exactly where the coyote was and what he was doing. As my Mustang told the
      coyote to leave, my Quarter horse lifted his head slightly, looked at the
      coyote and calmly looked at the Mustang, as if to say �I saw him too� and
      then they both went back to eating. Simply amazing I thought. Once again,
      I was so caught up in me, thinking I was smarter, I was being so aware, I
      am the superior being and all the while, the horses knew. They knew he was
      there before I saw him, they knew he was not a threat; they watched him as
      they ate and they knew when he got too close and when to warn him. What a
      great experience.<br />
      <br />
      I was so proud of my boys. Here they were, their own little herd, looking
      out for each other, being alert and aware, knowing how to handle the
      situation perfectly without panic, running, kicking and just the right
      amount of action. All of this without my help or interference. Wow, once
      again, I had to remind myself, horses know! They know what is going to
      happen before it happens. They are more aware than any of us can imagine.
      They are the ultimate survival animal. They are not mean and do not
      attack. They only want to be horses, seek comfort and avoid conflict. They
      know, because their life depends on it.<br />
      <br />
      So after big hugs, a sigh of relief and a few favorite scratches for both
      of them, it was time for me to leave this perfect herd and go back to my
      reality. Then it hit me. I was never really threatened by the coyote. I
      knew that my horses could take this guy on with no problem and I felt safe
      being with them, part of their herd. After the warning given by my
      Mustang, the coyote did not come any closer, however he did walk around us
      a few times before wondering off in the darkness of the night. In
      addition, when he left he walked the same way I was going to walk to get
      back to the barn, to my safety, to my truck and protection. This changed
      things for me. With the herd, I felt safe, now I had to walk back, alone,
      in a dark pasture, in the same direction that the coyote did, after seeing
      this rather brave coyote circle us as if he was checking us out and
      searching for weakness.<br />
      <br />
      As I walked back alone, since my herd was not going to leave their nice
      hay they were enjoying, I felt uneasy and vulnerable. I was walking and
      looking around quickly. I was not relaxed. I was not paying attention to
      much of anything, but constantly searching for that rather large coyote.
      As I got further away from my horses my uneasiness became greater. I was
      feeling and living what horses live everyday. I was suddenly not at the
      top of the food chain and I was the prey and knew there was a predator
      possibly stalking or hunting me.&nbsp; I took my hat off and waved and
      swatted at mosquitoes in an attempt to appear bigger and maybe scare the
      coyote, that I could not see but I was sure was out there. Somehow, the
      walk back seemed much longer than the walk out. As I got back to my truck
      without an encounter (that I knew of, maybe I was being watched) I
      suddenly got a better understanding of how horses live each moment of
      their life. Always uneasy, always watching and looking, rarely relaxing
      for fear they may miss something and always with that fear of being eaten
      if they drop their guard, fail to pay attention or get into a position
      where they cannot run or defend themselves. They know any mistake could be
      their last mistake.<br />
      <br />
      I am sure that everyone reading this at one time or another in their life,
      they were in a situation where they were scared, fearful and felt uneasy
      or lacked control. I hope they can remember this and gain a better
      understanding of how horses live each day. Maybe the next time their horse
      pulls, runs away, accidentally steps on them, reacts to a scary sound,
      spooks, throws their head quickly or they react to the horse eating baby
      stroller or bicycle; maybe you will have more patience and understanding
      that the fear the horse is feeling is real, never ending, deeply
      instinctive and never done to be mean or bad.<br />
      <br />

      <strong>Riding Your Horse in Rain</strong><br />
      <br />
      With the rainy season upon us, there will be great opportunities to enjoy
      a ride in the rain.&nbsp; I often get strange looks when I ride my horses
      in the rain.&nbsp; Later I hear people commenting that it is dangerous and
      my horse could slip, might get hurt or I hear there is no point in doing
      it, so why would anyone do it?&nbsp; These comments come from people who
      do not understand or are just unwilling or fearful of doing it, so they
      try to down play or do not understand the importance of it. Fear is a
      powerful thing in the horse world. Many use it so they do not have to
      progress or do things they are scared to do.<br />
      <br />
      Riding in the rain is so beneficial to you and your horse that it is hard
      to cover it all in one piece of writing.&nbsp; A ride in the rain teaches
      trust, confidence and balance to both you and your horse.&nbsp; For your
      horse, it is harder to balance while carrying you since he has less
      footing, is sliding or sinking in mud. The horse is trying to determine
      the depth of water puddles and is dealing with some loss of sight and
      hearing from the falling rain.&nbsp; With all this going on, the horse has
      to look to you for guidance, leadership and support.&nbsp; He looks to his
      leader for confidence and direction.&nbsp; He has to depend on you more
      and trust that you will not get him hurt, will not lead him into danger
      and will keep him safe.&nbsp; The better you do this, the more the horse
      will trust you and will see you as his unequivocal leader. It is a growing
      process for both. You must get over your fear and insecurity and the horse
      must learn it can do things with you on his back.<br />
      <br />
      This unknown area causes you to learn as much as the horse does.&nbsp; You
      learn how to help the horse and guide him even when you are a little
      insecure.&nbsp; You have to be much more aware of your horse�s
      capabilities and his strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; You have to balance
      more in order to stay out of the horse�s way and make it easier for him to
      carry you, without panicking or pulling on his head or reins.&nbsp; You
      have to trust his footing and reassure him if he gets nervous or
      insecure.&nbsp; You learn to control your fear and rely on your horse
      more.&nbsp;When you trust your horse, you horse trusts you. All of this
      while getting wet, having rain in your eyes and adjusting to the slicker
      reins and saddle.&nbsp; Your confidence in yourself, your riding ability
      and your horse grows expediential.&nbsp; This confidence is passed on to
      your horse and since a horse is a reflection of you, he grows as you
      grow.<br />
      <br />
      �But Rick, I have seen horses fall in the mud when it rains, isn�t this
      dangerous?�&nbsp; Walking up to a horse is dangerous, picking his feet is
      dangerous, trying to hold on to a lead rope, getting on a horse�s back,
      running a horse under saddle, jumping a horse, taking a horse to a show,
      trail riding and just about anything you do with a horse can be
      dangerous.&nbsp; If you are trying to avoid danger completely, you should
      not be around horses.&nbsp; I feel safer riding my horse down a slick rock
      cliff than I do having some people walk their horse near me.&nbsp; I have
      been hurt and nearly hurt ten times as much by other people�s horses and
      their mistakes, than by my own horses.&nbsp; It is never the horse�s fault
      and the horse always has to pay for their mistakes, your mistakes and
      other people mistakes.&nbsp; Try not to be caught up in the fear card
      played by many people.&nbsp; When people do not know how to do something
      or lack the ability, knowledge or confidence to do something, they will
      sometime use fear or it is dangerous to cover up the real reason.&nbsp;
      Riding a horse in the rain or mud is no more dangerous than many other
      things done with horses.&nbsp; Like many things, YOU need to adjust and
      learn how to minimize these risks, accept that there are some risks, learn
      to increase your skills, confidence and know when you are over your head.
      I say it on my site and in my videos, never do what someone tells you, you
      take the risk so do not substitute others advice or directions. Your
      horse, your responsibility.<br />
      <br />
      So how do you minimize the risk?&nbsp; You slow down, you think more, you
      concentrate more and you become more aware of your horse and how you are
      affecting your horse.&nbsp; When riding for the first time in the rain or
      mud, go slow.&nbsp; Take your horse to a place he is familiar with.&nbsp;
      Walk him and let him explore carrying you and deal with the mud and loss
      of secure footing.&nbsp; Stay out of his way, work on your balance and
      allow him to use his mind and body to figure out things. Be ready to
      provide direction and assistance if he gets scared or lost.&nbsp; Be ready
      to take him to a slow circle, a nice walk or an easy stop.&nbsp; Learn to
      give him his head, a horse uses his head for balance and he uses it more
      in mud, stay neutral in the saddle and know when to give him help.&nbsp;
      After showing him he can do it on flat level and familiar ground, then
      move to a good straight away, so you can do a slow controlled trot and a
      few downward transitions and stops.&nbsp; So trot and slow to a walk, then
      trot and do a stop.&nbsp; Do NOT do fast turns in mud, a horse�s legs get
      deep and they and pull a hip or stress a joint. Slow controlled movements
      are best to help a horse learn. This will all teach the horse how to
      adjust to the slicker surface and will let him know that he can still stop
      and turn if he slows down and does not get in a hurry or panic.&nbsp; All
      of this will be a little scary for both you and your horse, so you both
      have to depend on each other more.&nbsp; This is where the growth occurs,
      growth in ability and growth in confidence.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      �I do all my riding in an arena and never ride in the rain, why do I need
      to this?�&nbsp; If you ever go to a show, a trail ride, a parade, or just
      get caught in the rain sometime, this will be invaluable to you and your
      horse.&nbsp; By doing this when you control the situation, you set your
      horse up for success.&nbsp; If you ever have to do this when you did not
      plan it or when you get stuck doing it, you set your horse up for
      failure.&nbsp; Even if you never plan to ride in the rain, this is an
      invaluable lesson for you and your horse and real chance for growth and
      trust.&nbsp; It challenges you both, increases the bond and trust and
      redefines you as stronger and more confident leader.&nbsp; Of course
      riding after a good rain will give you most all the benefits as well, but
      the falling rain really makes the adventure a more rewarding and
      challenging experience.<br />
      <br />
      So dress warm, try to stay dry, get rid of the umbrella, saddle up and
      take advantage of a good ride in the rain.&nbsp; It will do you and your
      horse wonders.&nbsp; In addition, I assure you, after you are done, you
      will feel closer and see a better bond between you and your
      horse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing the freedom with our horse, enjoying the
      journey and growth through understanding all make horse ownership worth
      it.<br />
      <br />

      <strong>Twitching is all Bad?</strong><br />
      <br />
      Although I am not a fan of this, like a lot things, if done appropriately,
      can be helpful and when abused, can do more damage.&nbsp; Therefore, I
      post this with mixed emotions.&nbsp; I can only hope that if you are
      reading this, you are trying to learn more and educate yourself about
      horses and will not abuse them.&nbsp; Twitching strangely enough lowers
      the heart rate during an unpleasant procedure. A twitched horse's heart
      rate increases 8%. Horses not twitched during an unpleasant procedure
      experience a heart rate increase of 22%. The experts say that twitching
      causes an endorphin release that makes unpleasant experiences less
      stressful. Although I am not sure this is has been proven, the lower heart
      rate appears to be caused by something.<br />
      <br />
      In Australia, for example, the handlers who load horses into racing stalls
      used to be allowed a twitch, but that procedure was outlawed some years
      ago.&nbsp; Is this a good thing or bad thing? You have to ask yourself why
      would a country outlaw a simple procedure.&nbsp; In fact, most Aussie�s
      think Americans are barbaric for still using this procedure.&nbsp; I
      stress the phrase, when done or used appropriately, it can be
      helpful.&nbsp; Done properly, twitching can defuse what could be a
      dangerous situation for a horse.&nbsp; The physical aspect of a twitch is
      to stimulate the body to release endorphins. This is kind of like giving
      the horse a shot of heroin (it gets them stoned or buzzed).&nbsp; It is a
      powerful and natural relaxant in theory.&nbsp; One theory is some
      predators instinctively know this and use this to their benefit. When
      lions grab a zebra, one usually latches onto the nose. That is not to shut
      off the air (that's done by the one at the throat), but to release
      endorphins. It is a natural preparation for death.&nbsp;Again, this is
      theory and not scientific evidence.<br />
      <br />
      Note: A war bridle is not a twitch. I have pictures and explain what a war
      bridle is on my web site.<br />
      <br />
      A twitch has to be controlled, which means it has to be able to be
      released and tightened as the situation develops.&nbsp; The most common
      twitches are neck, ear, nose and gum line.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      The neck twitch is done with the hand and is used to simulate a horse bite
      or a horse grabbing another horse by the neck.&nbsp; You will see a mommy
      horse disciplining their young by biting and holding them by the neck
      area.&nbsp; I have also seen older geldings do this to other horses to
      teach them.&nbsp; This neck grab will sometime calm a horse and or
      distract him enough that you can mess with an injury or give him a
      shot.&nbsp; The ear twitch is not good or effective and I think, tend to
      cause a horse to be ear shy, can damage the ear and is more of a pain
      compliance and not a relaxant.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      The nose twitch seems to be the one of choice and it can be applied with
      the hand, rope or chain.&nbsp; Obviously, I do not like the stupid chain
      idea, but somewhere, a brilliant horse idiot came up with this revelation
      and decided that if a hand or rope worked then a chain would work better.
      �NEWS FLASH� - Chains and horses are BAD!&nbsp; So back to the hand or
      rope, by squeezing the nose, endorphins are released and the horse is
      apparently relaxed and preoccupied with you squeezing his nose, so he is
      less likely to react to you cleaning a painful injury or giving him a
      shot.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      The gum line seems to be used by Farriers mostly.&nbsp; It may work but,
      once again, there is a propensity for abuse or over use.&nbsp; A twitch is
      a last resort before using a tranquilizer or other drug.&nbsp; It should
      not be the first (easy) choice and should be used by EXCEPTION and not
      routine. (IMHO)<br />
      <br />
      I often hear of horse being burned alive in burning barns. A twitch could
      be used in this situation to get compliance from the horse so you can save
      them. If the option is a horse stays in the barn and dies or I use a
      twitch, chain or cattle prod to get the horse out, obviously getting the
      horse out, at any cost, is better than letting it die.<br />
      <br />
      Happy trials,<br />

      <strong>What is a Cheat?</strong><br />
      <br />
      Let�s talk about Cheats:&nbsp; I use this term a lot in the horse world.
      Synonyms of cheat are to defraud, to take advantage of, con, trick,
      swindle or deceive. So when I use this term to refer to different things
      people use on horses, people get offended or insulted. This is not a
      personal issue.&nbsp; Most any cheat can be an effective aid if used in
      moderation with a good thinking horseperson, with the goal being to use it
      short term.&nbsp; I will list a few cheats that I see used too often with
      horses; A stud chain, a whip, a martingale, draw reins, spurs, tie downs,
      bits, pain and fear.&nbsp; Hold on, I know many are thinking, wait a
      minute, I use some of these and �I am not a cheater.�&nbsp; Remember what
      I said earlier about moderation and thinking.&nbsp; There are many other
      cheats in horse training and after reading this, you may identify others
      that you did not see as a cheat before.<br />
      <br />
      Let�s discuss why I think a cheat is a cheat.&nbsp; A stud chain causes
      pain; it is designed and used so it can cause pain to get compliance.
      Chains, no matter how they are used, are used to cause pain to a horse.
      Can it be used and not cause pain, yes, but if it is available, the
      likelihood is it will be used for pain.&nbsp; If it was not available,
      then it will not be used for pain and you have to learn how to get what
      you want without pain.&nbsp; Therefore, I hear all the time, �I don�t use
      it, he just knows it is there� or �If he listens then he does not get it
      used on him (pain)�.&nbsp; Both these statements are cheats.&nbsp; What is
      really being said is I do not know any other way to control my horse, so I
      use what is easy, fast and works.&nbsp; The easy way is rarely the right
      way.&nbsp; The right way normally takes more time and more effort.&nbsp;
      By taking the easy way, you cheat. We all do it, I have done it and still
      do it sometime, but it needs to be the exception and not the rule.&nbsp;
      When you cheat, you cheat your horse and you cheat yourself.&nbsp; I can
      take most any horse being led around on a stud chain and lead the horse
      better and with more control with a simple rope halter, in less than ten
      minutes. Not because I am special or have magical horse whisper power, but
      because I understand horses, I know if I was a horse what I would want, I
      know that if I take a little more time, I get a better final product.<br />
      <br />
      When you only use cheats or over use them, I think you take something from
      the horse.&nbsp; You change the horse in a way that you never get
      back.&nbsp; You change the very being and steal some of his soul.&nbsp;
      Who would want a horse that will not move unless told, will not think on
      his own, has no personality, will not react to anything and is basically a
      mindless robot that you sit on and bark off commands?&nbsp; It seems too
      many people are always chasing this type of horse. People that want this
      are usually fearful and lack the confidence to truly understand and trust
      a horse. They do not trust themselves so they do not trust the horse. Most
      all issues people have with horses come from fear and lack of
      understanding.<br />
      <br />
      Most problems with horses (really people) come down to time, fear, being
      in a hurry and lack of knowledge.&nbsp; If people just slowed down, took
      the time it takes, it would take less time.&nbsp; The slow way is the fast
      way with horses.&nbsp; Most cheats are used for faster and easier
      results.&nbsp; Therefore, you may think it helps in the short term, but
      overtime, cheats become less and less effective.&nbsp; Not only do people
      start relying on them, but also horses start relying on them.&nbsp; Ever
      see a horse that has always had a tie down, if you take it off, the horse
      is almost lost and fearful, the head is high and appears out of control,
      since the horse has never been allowed to learn how to carry his head
      without restraints.&nbsp; Most all cheats do not improve your relationship
      with your horse, it normally damages it.&nbsp; So overtime when cheats
      stop working, they are normally used more and with more effort, since
      people have become dependant on them.&nbsp; The more you use a cheat the
      less effective it becomes and the less effective you are.&nbsp; You can
      desensitize a horse to just about anything, including cheats.&nbsp; If I
      slap a horse in the face every time I see him, sooner or later he will
      expect this, know it is going to happen and will stop trying to prevent
      it.&nbsp; If you constantly correct a horse with a stud chain or a bit,
      sooner or later your horse will expect it and ignore it.&nbsp; At some
      point, the horse may decide enough is enough and hurt you.&nbsp; �Hard
      hands make hard horses.�<br />
      <br />
      I think if people are more aware of cheats and the cheats they use, they
      will be less likely to over use them and will be thinking of ways to get
      the same results without the cheat. You will learn to get more from your
      horse with less.&nbsp; For example, if I can get a horse to lead well with
      a rope halter, then I can try to get him to lead well with just a rope
      around his neck.&nbsp; Once he is good at that, then I can try to get him
      to lead with just a piece of hay string around his neck and once he is
      good at that, then I can get him to lead with nothing around his
      neck.&nbsp; By looking at most horse training this way, you are always
      working your horsemanship (horsewomanship) and you are constantly
      improving and making it better for the horse.&nbsp; If you take care of
      your horsemanship, your horsemanship will take care of you.&nbsp; When you
      improve yourself, your horse improves.&nbsp; When you and your horse
      understand each other, your partnership and bond grows, and everything you
      do with your horse seems effortless and like a dance.&nbsp; You would
      never find beauty in a dancer, if a whip or spurs were used to make the
      dancer dance.<br />
      <br />
      Know your cheats, use them sparingly and always try to stop using them, so
      you do not have to depend on them.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Happy Trails,&nbsp;<br />

      <strong>What is a Draw?</strong><br />
      <br />
      I get the weirdest looks when I tell people you need to draw your horse
      in, you need to create a draw and you need to use the horse�s natural
      draw.&nbsp; So what am I talking about when I say Draw?&nbsp;
      Understanding this seems easy to me, but hard to explain.&nbsp; It is like
      a mind game with your horse, I have to act submissive and non-threatening,
      I have to make the horse think and want to follow me, I need to get small
      and non-predatory, I want him to get curious and investigative of what I
      am doing and why I am doing it.&nbsp; I have to have my timing down to
      give release at just the right time.&nbsp; Horses are curious creatures
      anyway, they just get that beat out of them or corrected out of them or
      �RESPECT MY SPACE� out of them.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      People are so busy trying to control their horse that they forget that a
      horse is just horse and this is all it knows how to be.&nbsp; I get so
      tired of seeing people who yank, pull, push, correct, backup, yell and
      blame their horse for �Just being a horse�.&nbsp; If you spend all your
      time keeping your horse away from you, how in the world are you going to
      get your horse to want to be with you? Think about it.&nbsp; If every time
      your horse rubs you, touches you or gets close to you, all you do is push
      him out and yell �Respect my space�, is it any wonder your horse won�t
      come to you when called or wants to run from you when it gets loose?&nbsp;
      It seems pretty simple to me.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      Draw is playing cat and mouse with your horse, looking at him and then
      backing away, in a way that makes him interested and curious. Horse do it
      to each other all the time. I can get most any horse to follow me by just
      walking away, but it is the way I walk away. It is my body language, my
      facial expression, my posture, the position of my head, where my eyes
      look, how I hang my arms and probably some other things that I don�t even
      know I am doing, but I assure you the horse knows! Higher horses always
      seem aloof &nbsp;in herds. They do not beg horses to follow them.<br />
      <br />
      A natural draw is where a horse wants to be or wants to go on his
      own.&nbsp; Good natural draws are a grain bucket, a gate to leave the
      arena, the barn or other horses.&nbsp; If a horse wants to go to these
      places, use this to get your horse to learn what you are trying to
      teach.&nbsp; Like crossing water, if I am going away from the bran and I
      try to get my horse to cross a stream, for the first time, it will be
      harder than if I am on my way back to the barn and try the same
      stream.&nbsp; One way I am working against the horse natural draw and
      facing away from the barn or home, the other way, I am working with the
      horse and facing the barn.&nbsp; Know the difference.&nbsp; A good
      horseman knows how to draw a horse, because he understands a horse and
      �thinks like a horse�.&nbsp; This is why you should not work on stopping
      on the way back to the barn.&nbsp; You should work on stopping going away
      from the barn.&nbsp; That way the horse wants to stop and thinks you may
      turn around and go back to the barn.&nbsp; If you try to work on stops
      going back to the barn, then you horse gets nervous and anxious thinking
      you may not go to the barn. When leaving a draw you create more or
      stronger draw.<br />
      <br />
      When teaching a horse to come to you, let�s say in a round pen, most
      horses want to leave the round pen.&nbsp; They know in the pen, they
      work.&nbsp; Therefore, if I stand at the gate and call a horse, he comes
      easy, thinking we are going to leave.&nbsp; If I stand across (opposite)
      from the gate and call a horse, a horse has a natural draw to the gate and
      will want to stand at the gate and will not be as willing to come to me,
      which is away from the his draw (gate).&nbsp; I see this all the time,
      people working against a draw and then blaming the horse for being
      stubborn.&nbsp; It is not and never was the horse's fault.&nbsp; Learn
      your horse's natural draws and use them to help teach him what you
      want.&nbsp; This way you help your horse succeed, set him up for success
      and make finding the right answer easy.&nbsp; You have to try less to get
      what you want from your horse and you do not have to fight or force
      things, which hamper your relationship with horses.&nbsp; Remember with
      horses "less is more" and "the slow way is the fast way".&nbsp; Some
      people just like to fight and "show the horse who is boss" rather than
      work smarter and help the horse without force or fear.&nbsp; The old
      saying, "You can't fix stupid" applies to these people.&nbsp; It is just
      too bad the horse has to endure man's stupidity and then the horse is
      blamed for being a horse. Pushing and correcting a horse for being your
      space is not the way to teach a horse that you are a draw. Know the
      difference.<br />

      <strong>Hard to Catch Horse</strong><br />
      <br />
      Catching horses and trailer loading seem to be two of the biggest problems
      for many horse owners. I get asked all the time, why won�t my horse let me
      catch him? My first advice is �Stop trying to catch him�. A horse knows
      what is going to happen before it happens. This is because their life
      depends on it. If they get caught not paying attention, they are dead,
      eaten or seriously wounded (which means certain death). Horses have to
      know what is happening around them or they die. It is that simple for the
      horse and is very instinctive. I have a few videos on hard to catch horses
      on Youtube:<br />
      <br />
      By not trying to catch a horse, a horse will not try to get away from
      being caught. You can still catch him, it may take a little longer, but
      remember, �The slow way is the fast way with horses.� Therefore, by just
      approaching your horse to pet them, to say hello, to bring them a treat,
      you tell the horse you are NOT trying to catch them, so they do not react
      to being caught. A horse will not run from someone who is not chasing or
      putting pressure on them. So if you go after a horse with a purpose of
      catching him, go straight to his head, like a predator, and only approach
      your horse when you want or need to catch him, it will not take him long
      for him to figure out what you are up to. If you were a horse, you would
      know this and would not want to get caught either.<br />
      <br />
      So how do you hide this idea of catching your horse from your horse? It is
      not easy. Since horses are the king of observation and do not miss much,
      you really have to use your horse sense. You do not want to look at the
      head, or look into the horse�s eyes, do not reach out with your hands, do
      not sneak up and do not talk. You really need to understand pressure,
      release and driveline. You have to think that you are approaching your
      horse only to say hello and to rub his withers. By focusing on that, you
      will not telegraph your intention to catch the horse. So your objective is
      to pet the horse at the withers, not to catch him. If you think you are
      fooling the horse and you try to only pet him when the real intent is
      catching him, he will know it and you will fail. You cannot hide your
      intentions from a horse. �Horses keep you honest.� The old saying: If you
      think you can or think you can�t, you are probably right.<br />
      <br />
      Now, that information will only get you so far. You still have to be aware
      of pressure and release. Anytime you approach a horse, even just to pet it
      or bring it a treat, you need to move as if you are the Alpha, high horse,
      and you understand horse language. By knowing when to put pressure on and
      when to release pressure, how to create a draw, you communicate with your
      horse and your horse knows that you talk horse. You make the horse know
      your intentions and you make the horse feel that you are not a threat.
      When you see birds, deer, rabbits or other animals hanging out with
      horses, you do not see horses caring or reacting to them. They know these
      things are not a threat and are not trying to catch them or hurt them.
      Horses do not know this about you, until you tell them. You tell them this
      with your body language, not your mouth and saying �good boy�. You read
      the horse and know when he is getting nervous or when you are putting too
      much pressure, so you know when to release that pressure. If your horse
      tries to leave, you need to know how to move in front of the driveline,
      just enough to stop his forward movement. The more you control the horse�s
      movement, by anticipating what he is going to do, the more you tell the
      horse you control him and he will have less incentive to move away from
      you. If you do not know how to lunge or round pen a horse and create a
      draw and make a horse come to you or follow you, you will not be
      successful at catching a horse.<br />
      <br />
      Release is the key to any and all horse handling. Knowing when to release
      is timing. Knowing how much to release is feel. Understanding this is
      critical if you want to be successful with horses. Whether it is release
      of bit pressure, release of leg pressure, release of drive pressure,
      knowing when and how much to release will enable you to get great results
      from any horse you work with.<br />
      <br />
      So, for the hard to catch horses, the smart ones, you need to be smarter.
      Do not think catch and do not chase them. Simply understand how horses
      talk, how they communicate, be like the horse and join up with your horse.
      If you can communicate that you are the herd leader and you are higher,
      then you horse will always allow you to approach him, just do not try to
      catch him.<br />
      <br />

      <strong>Horse Shoes - Pros and Cons</strong><br />
      <br />
      Too little land to support horse herds; Too many wild horses; No place for
      wild herds; BLM to euthanize over 30,000 Wild Mustangs; and many other
      head lines about how there is not enough land to support wild herds, yet
      the herds keep growing�&nbsp; How can this be?&nbsp; There are no stalls
      in the wild, no blankets, no worming schedules, no shots, no fresh Alfalfa
      and worst of all NO horse shoes!&nbsp; So how do all these horses keep
      living and reproducing so abundantly?&nbsp; How in the world can all these
      horses continue to survive and thrive without the help of humans?&nbsp;
      (Read my Horse History page for more information about the history of
      horses)<br />
      <br />
      I have just added an "Amazing Horse Hoof" page to my web site with lots of
      hoof information:<br />
      <br />
      I have a photo on this page that shows a thermograph image of a horse with
      only one horse shoe on. It is very easy to see the lack of blood flow to
      the shod hoof and very easy to see the good blood flow to the three unshod
      hooves. Study after study keeps confirming that metal shoes nailed into
      the hoof causes pain, impaction damage, stress fractures and prevents the
      hoof from operating like it should.<br />
      <br />
      Horses have been around for countless years.&nbsp; Somehow, they continue
      to grow in numbers, even with the shrinking supply of open lands.&nbsp;
      The reason is simple; they are a perfect example of �survival of the
      fittest.� Natural thinning of the herd by many factors, including man and
      an exceptional ability to adapt to different environments, enables them to
      flourish both in the wild and in domestication.&nbsp; A couple of things
      you do not see in the wild are horseshoes and Farriers.&nbsp; Over the
      thousands and millions of years, horses have never been shod in the
      wild.&nbsp; Yet somehow, they continue to thrive, grow and succeed.<br />
      <br />
      Yes, horseshoes have been around for a number of years and were developed,
      designed and promoted for the benefit of man. Let me say this again,
      nailing metal shoes to horse�s hoof was designed to help man, NOT the
      horse.&nbsp; Horseshoes are used to keep horses in unnatural environments,
      such as stalled and on stoned floors where the horse was never meant to be
      kept for long periods of time.&nbsp; In these man-made conditions, the
      horse�s hoof deteriorates from the lack of exercise and blood flow, the
      urine and feces soaked floors destroy the hoof�s reliability, create
      bacteria pools, the shavings and arena footings strip the moisture from
      the hoof making it brittle and frail and the many unnatural footing does
      not facilitate chipping or natural hoof sculpting.&nbsp; However, these
      conditions do make it easier for the rider to catch their horse, easier to
      keep their horse clean, easier to keep the horse free of natural scarps
      and cuts from horse play and herd behavior and easier to ride their horse
      without concern for the footing or ground conditions, but it does nothing
      for the benefit of the horse.&nbsp; Other ways man have been able to
      weaken the horse�s foot is by over breeding, inner breeding and close
      bloodline breeding, all of which have contributed to weakening the hoof
      wall of the horse.&nbsp; Racing Thoroughbreds are a perfect example of
      this and the Quarter Horse breed is rapidly following the same path.&nbsp;
      In simple terms, domestication of the horse and man�s interference as led
      to a weaker and genetically flawed hoof for the horse.<br />
      <br />
      Horse shoes are more convenient, makes it easier on the rider, may prevent
      some soft sole bruising, will allow for longer work hours on the horse and
      will make the hoof temporarily stronger since it is metal, non-bendable
      and non-flexible.&nbsp; Shoes normally only have to be replaced every six
      to eight weeks and will allow the rider to run and trot over rocks and
      uneven terrain with less chance of stone bruising.&nbsp; In some rare
      occasions, the horseshoe can be used to help a cracked hoof or injured
      hoof to aid in healing and support.&nbsp; Horseshoes can also be used for
      gait management or to improve other movements of the horse.&nbsp; In most
      all cases, horseshoes are for the benefit of the human, not for the
      horse.<br />
      <br />
      So what are some of the cons to horse shoes?&nbsp; A shoe is made of metal
      or other hard non-flexible material or impact intensifying
      substance.&nbsp; This creates extreme shock and transfers much more stress
      on the hoof, bones and tendons. A shod hoof receives 10 to 33 times more
      "impact force" than a hoof this is not shod.&nbsp; Shoes have to be nailed
      onto the hoof, in most cases.&nbsp; These nails puncture the hoof wall,
      which compromises the structural integrity and strength of that
      wall.&nbsp; It also allows for foreign material to now access to the
      internal hoof where infection can set in and cause real problems.&nbsp; If
      the nail is only an 1/8th of inch off it can puncture the sensitive
      laminae, damage the soft tissue, penetrate the hoof capsule or puncture
      the digital cushion.&nbsp; All of which can cause infection, swelling,
      bleeding, lameness and extreme pain to the horse.&nbsp; (Another name for
      this is called a �Hot Nail� or �Quicking�)&nbsp; Not to mention that the
      number one cause of lameness, in shod horses, is bad or incorrect
      shoeing.&nbsp; The shock from metal shoes transformed up the hoof and leg
      can cause chronic lameness, damage to the hoof wall and arthritis in later
      years.<br />
      <br />
      Other disadvantages to horseshoes are they cause horses to slip on paved
      roads and rocks and cause loss of footing on hills and uneven
      ground.&nbsp;A barefoot horse has better footing than a shod horse.
      Horseshoes can spark when hitting or sliding on rocks, which causes fires
      that burn pastures, fences, kill livestock and our horses.&nbsp;
      Horseshoes prevent the hoof from flexing and avert the self-adapting
      qualities of the hoof.&nbsp; Horses can injury themselves when the rear
      shoe clips or over-steps onto the rear of the front hooves, causing
      bruising, cuts and lameness. &nbsp;A kick from a shod horse will break a
      leg bone of another horse and do much more damage than an unshod hoof,
      causing the euthanasia of many horses.&nbsp; When a shoe falls off or is
      stepped on and pulled off, the horse is forced to walk around off balance,
      which creates pain and possible injury to other parts of the horse.&nbsp;
      When shoes are thrown or come off in pasture, the rusty and unsanitary
      nails of these shoes stick up and puncture the sole or other horses
      creating lameness, infection and injury.&nbsp; Not to beat a dead horse,
      so to speak, but I think I covered enough negatives on shoes, but I am
      sure there are still many others.<br />
      <br />
      On my hoof page of my website, there is an excellent example of a working
      barefoot hoof flexing.&nbsp; (A shoe prevents this flexing from
      happening)<br />
      <br />
      The benefits of barefoot are many and very achievable if more people would
      get the facts, do their own research and be open to an alternative, to
      nailing shoes on a horse.&nbsp; Keeping your horse barefoot takes more
      caution on your part.&nbsp; You may have to get off and walk your horse
      over large rocks for his comfort and to remove your additional weight
      while walking on rocky terrain.&nbsp; This is a small price to pay for the
      many disadvantages of having shoes.&nbsp; People who ride shod horses
      think that shoes prevent rocks from bruising the hoof sole.&nbsp; This is
      a not true, anyone can look at a horse shoe and see that it will only
      prevent rocks from hitting the horse shoe part of the hoof, the entire
      center sole and frog area are still exposed and susceptible stone bruising
      and punctures.&nbsp; Shod horses have much softer soles since they never
      get tough, since they are protected by the shoe.&nbsp; Barefoot hooves are
      allowed to flex and function more naturally.&nbsp; This naturally flexing,
      increases blood flow, which increases growth and strength of the
      hoof.&nbsp; The longer a horse is barefoot the stronger the hoof
      becomes.&nbsp; An unshod hoof gets stronger and tougher and the need for
      shoeing becomes less and less.&nbsp; Footing is enhanced with a natural
      hoof as opposed to a shod hoof.&nbsp; Nails around the barn, in the
      pasture and in the hoof - almost vanish.&nbsp; Shoeing expenses are
      decreased and natural barefoot trimming is replaced.&nbsp; In non-shod
      horses, the horse is spared the nails, the metal weight, shock and stress
      transfer, the chance of a hot nail, poor fitting shoes, uneven shoeing and
      many other negatives that come with shoeing.<br />
      <br />
      Most Farriers agree that barefoot is better and a more healthy option for
      most horses.&nbsp; However, if the client wants shoes, most will not try
      to convince them not to have them.&nbsp; I have put some reference links
      at the bottom of this article and hope that people will take the time to
      educate themselves so they have a better understanding of horseshoes and
      barefoot horses and maybe be equipped to make a better informed
      decision.&nbsp; I have a collection of many hoof and other anatomy
      pictures at this link:<br />
      <br />
      My horses are barefoot.&nbsp; I like keeping my horses as natural as I
      can.&nbsp; Am I bias about horseshoes?&nbsp; You bet I am and the reason
      is; �If I was a horse, I would not want nails or shoes on my feet� I am
      always bias to do what is better for the horse.<br />

      <strong>Is a Riding Helmet Bad? Does it Make You Safe?</strong><br />
      <br />
      Every person that thinks a helmet is a safety item will disagree with this
      title. Every parent that wants his or her child to wear a helmet will
      disagree with this title.&nbsp; Every person that is scared of his or her
      horse and wants to wear a helmet will disagree with this title.<br />
      <br />
      I tend to cover topics of common sense and topics that are controversial.
      I speak for the horse and most all my articles will take the horse�s side
      and the horse�s point of view. That is not normally the most popular side.
      So how does a helmet help the horse? I will try to explain.<br />
      <br />
      I am sure there are many of you out there that think a helmet is needed
      when riding a horse and some even think it should be mandatory.&nbsp; Like
      many things in the horse world, opinions vary depending on experience and
      knowledge.&nbsp; So if a helmet protects someone�s head and makes them
      safer, how can it be bad?&nbsp; There is a condition out there known as
      the �Superman Syndrome�.&nbsp; The condition is when someone perceives no
      danger can come to them, they are safe, protected and cannot get
      hurt.&nbsp; This syndrome is common in many high-risk professions such as
      Police Officers, Firefighters, Military personnel, Race Car drivers and
      others. Years ago, a bull rider would never wear a helmet much less a kick
      proof vest and now this is very common.<br />
      <br />
      With advances in technology and safety equipment, people have a tendency
      to think they cannot get hurt when doing dangerous activities since they
      wear safety gear.&nbsp; With this mindset, it causes people to take more
      risks and greater risks and they will do things they would never do, if
      they felt they could get seriously hurt. Here is my take.&nbsp; Riders and
      horse owners will neglect improving their skills or advancing their
      knowledge of the horse, since they can take a shortcut, use a cheat, get
      lots of free advice and of course, wear a helmet that keeps them safe.
      Helmets DO NOT make you safe on a horse.&nbsp; This is a very commons
      misconception.<br />
      <br />
      Here is a study that was done in Australia:<br />

    <br />
    <br />
    On my website, I discuss a test in "Fear" that was done where rider were
    told they would be sprayed with a fire hose as they rode their horse by this
    specific area. All riders and horses showed signs of stress and fear when
    passing the area, even thou no rider or horse was ever sprayed.&nbsp; Do not
    forget, the did not know anything about the water or being sprayed, so why
    did his stress level rise? A horse knows when you are scared.&nbsp; Many
    people that wear helmets are scared, fearful, and insecure and the horse
    knows it.&nbsp; You can read more about fear on my website:&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    I see many people that ride horses that they should not ride, but they wear
    a helmet.&nbsp; I see riders push their horse when scared, but they wear a
    helmet.&nbsp; I see harsh and painful bits being used by people with hard
    hands, but they wear a helmet.&nbsp; I see horses confused, scared and in
    pain, but their rider wears a helmet.&nbsp; I see horses begging and
    screaming for their rider to stop pulling on their mouth and head.&nbsp; I
    see riders carrying on conversations and ignoring all the warning signs that
    their horse is about to blow, but they wear a helmet.&nbsp; To me wearing a
    helmet when you are on a unsafe horse is pointless and makes a dangerous
    situation more dangerous. It creates the illusion that you cannot get hurt
    or that you are protected, since you wear a helmet.<br />
    <br />
    Thousands of people a year get hurt in horse related accidents.&nbsp; Most,
    if not all, could be prevented with better horse skills, more informed and
    educated riders, but the majority of people hurt by horses, were wearing a
    helmet.&nbsp; A helmet will not protect you from a broken arm, broken back
    or broken ribs.&nbsp; It will not prevent a neck or spinal injury.&nbsp; It
    will not prevent you from being thrown or from being dragged if you foot is
    caught in a stirrup.&nbsp; A helmet will not prevent you from being kicked
    in head, stepped on, run over or severely bitten by a horse.&nbsp; A horse
    reacts the same way whether or not his rider is wearing a helmet. Only the
    rider seems to think a helmet changes things, a horse has no knowledge of a
    helmet or what it does.<br />
    <br />
    Many people that are loyal helmet people will get upset about this article.
    If they do they are missing the purpose. They are making this about them and
    their feelings and not about growing, understanding horses better and
    growing in their horsemanship.<br />
    <br />
    A helmet may give people the perception that they are safe.&nbsp; A big
    thing a helmet does is it makes the horse pay.&nbsp; The horse suffers from
    people who will not learn about the horse since they can wear a helmet and
    then make the horse listen with bigger bits, more force and since they think
    they are safe with their helmet, the horse pays.&nbsp; If people invested
    time to study the horse, if they would try to improve their horse skills and
    learn the way of the horse, they would be 100 times safer with no
    helmet.&nbsp;I would equate this to sky diving. You can jump out of a plane
    falling to the earth at 120 miles per hour and for liability reasons,
    insurance requires you wear a helmet. Does anyone see the irony in this?<br />
    <br />
    It amazes me when people won�t ride a horse without a helmet, yet they will
    get on a horse that does not have good brakes, won�t steer, will spook and
    run off, is nervous and insecure and then they feel safer because they have
    a helmet on.&nbsp; Most people wear seatbelts in car.&nbsp; Seatbelts have
    saved countless lives and minimized injuries for years.&nbsp; However, just
    because you wear a seatbelt, would you drive a car with no brakes, bad
    steering, bald tires, broken windshield and broken steering wheel?&nbsp; I
    would hope not.&nbsp; If you did, you would still be safer in that car than
    you would be on a lot of horses I see people ride.&nbsp; At least the car
    will not spook, the car does not have a mind with instincts to run and
    survive.&nbsp; The car will not chase other cars or run from other
    cars.&nbsp; The car will not react to pain or fear.&nbsp; The car will not
    panic and think it could die when scared.&nbsp; A car will not buck and try
    to throw you out. The same people that think helmets should be mandatory on
    horses do not wear a helmet when driving a car.<br />
    <br />
    So let us compare, the car has no emotions, no fear, no reactions, you have
    complete control over the accelerator, which direction you go, and you can
    turn the engine off with a turn of a key.&nbsp; The horse has strong
    emotions, lots of fear, reacts to survive and you have little control over
    the accelerator, limited control of direction and you cannot turn the horse
    off.&nbsp; Ummmmm?&nbsp; Which one do you think you are safer driving?&nbsp;
    Which one do you think you have more control over?&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    I bet a lot of people would not drive the car I described with a seatbelt,
    helmet and a protective suit, yet they have no problem getting on an
    untrained and unsafe horse - since they have a helmet on. Or better yet,
    these people have no problem putting their kid on a horse with no knowledge
    of the horse as long as the kid is wearing a helmet.<br />
    <br />
    People should actually think about what a helmet really does.&nbsp; Can a
    helmet really make you safe?&nbsp; The purpose of this article is to help
    people think. I hope riders will realize that by working on your horse
    skills and understanding the horse better will make you much safer than the
    best helmet you wear.&nbsp; If you improve yourself, your horse will get
    better.&nbsp; By doing this, the real winner is the horse.&nbsp; The horse
    gets a rider and owner that understands him better, the horse gets a better
    deal and the horse knows his rider grows in confidence so he grows and they
    both become better and safer partners.<br />
    <br />
    So wearing a helmet may help you if you get thrown or fall off, but
    understanding your horse, understanding their instinctive fear reactions and
    working on becoming a better horse person, will help keep you from getting
    thrown.&nbsp; Help yourself and your horse become safer through
    understanding and knowledge of the horse.<br />
    <br />
    So it is OK to wear a helmet, sure it is. However, do not expect it to make
    you a better horseman or make your horse better, that is up to you.<br />
    <br />
    Hope this clears up why I think helmets can be bad if they used to justify
    neglecting your horsemanship. Remember, if you take care of your
    horsemanship, your horsemanship will take care of you.<br />
    <br />
    Happy Trails,<br />

        >ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AFTER ALL THE WHINING AND CRYING FROM THE HELMET
        LOVERS:</strong
      ><br />
      <br />
      Shut the hell up about your helmet. Look people, I have my beliefs and
      maybe you barn witches can run around your barns and beat up on people
      that don't agree with you, that dog won't hunt here. Well I know this is
      not popular, but getting on safe horses is better than requiring people to
      wear helmets. 1000 times more people ride horses with no helmets and don't
      get hurt than the ones that get hurt. Top killers are fires in homes, slip
      and falls in tubs, drowning - should outlaw water, not allow fire in homes
      - it is always too easy to call for MORE laws and control on emotional sad
      deaths - it is unreasonable and does not work.<br />
      <br />
      Lots of people get hurt in car wrecks, we still drive, everyone dies when
      a plane crashes we still fly, but we all a choice NOT to fly or not to
      drive and NOT to ride a horse. But it amazes me how quick people to jump
      on Helmets should mandatory.<br />
      <br />
      I guess it goes back to riding a motorcycle with no helmet, I did it for
      years, I am still alive and in liberal Gov freakout control states there
      is a helmet law and in Texas it is YOUR CHOICE -<br />
      <br />
      I am in favor of choices NOT more LAWS or rules from the few that think
      they always have the right perfect brilliant answer to save everyone.<br />
      <br />
      Cant ride a bycicle without a helmet, toys are outlawed -Cue dumass that
      is going to say " A helmet saved my life and I think everyone should wear
      one." Got over nanny state lovers. Horses are dangerous, if you don't like
      it, stay away, wear a helmet, wrap yourself in bubble wrap, but shut up
      with your knowit all attitude about forcing everyone else to do something
      since you are scared of something. Same crap on the gun laws and cry
      babies.<br />
      <br />
      In response to a web site that sells pink helmets and matching pink safety
      jackets posting an emotional story about a kid dying from a horse
      accident:<br />
      <br />
      I say you have a choice to decide what you do, what you call asking others
      to have common sense is choices everyone already has. Put the blame where
      it belongs, maybe the parents should not have put their kid on a horse,
      maybe the kid was pressured, maybe the organization that put this article
      out is just a money driven group that wants to cause fear in order to sell
      their first item the PINK safety jacket - with matching pink helmet.<br />
      <br />
      This is typical propaganda, highlight the rare, pull on emotional heart
      stings to push your agenda. This site is using this kid to sell their
      product and get others to think with their emotions. IMHO<br />
      <br />
      No different than the Gov and Media does with Gun incidents, create fear
      to gain power, control or money.<br />
      <br />
      A simple concept, show a picture of hurt child, use the words protect or
      safety to inch in more control or laws or beliefs that will give you
      power, control or money. Works every time with the emotional or
      uninformed. Make it popular and attack those that disagree or speak out
      and soon the majority will think it is true. I could give a 1000 examples
      - global warming, seat belts, safety caps on kool aid, required knee pads
      or wrist pads when skating, vest for bull riders, video games out lawed,
      farmers can't let their kids help on a farm since one kid was hurt by farm
      equipment, kids getting suspended for wearing a shirt with a picture gun
      on it, someone jumps off a bridge and now millions are spent on suicide
      nets on bridges - years of brainwashing, telling people what to think and
      not how to think - dumbing down a nation so since they are too stupid to
      decide for themselves and they don't have to use common sense since they
      depend on rules, laws and warning labels to protect their stupidity.
      Choice is freedom, we make cars that go 200 mph and then make speed limits
      well below 100 ? Choices are freedom - I am just a crazy freedom type guy
      I guess - and obviously a dying breed in today's world.<br />
      <br />
      In response some dumass English rider with her matching boots and helmet
      saying everyone should wear a helmet then she has a picture of her on a
      horse with no helmet and claims she took it off to take the picture so
      that was OK:<br />
      <br />
      My point exactly, so your theory is that when taking a picture, your horse
      could not have a reaction? really? I see this all time, it starts with
      wear a helmet, then not when taking pictures, then someone gets hurt
      leading a horse so now we need to wear a helmet when walking a horse, then
      someone gets kicked when feeding a horse and now we need the same vest
      that the bull riders wear when feeding a horse, where does it start and
      where does it stop? Here is a crazy concept, maybe it starts and ends with
      an individual choice?<br />
      <br />
      In response to people only saying helmets are good:<br />
      <br />
      Well I noticed there is not one talking about the number of accidents that
      are CAUSED by helmets - it blocks vision, it blocks hearing, it the neck
      or helmet is snapped back it causes damage at the base of spine and neck
      area, if a tree branch or something catches a helmet it will pull a riders
      off. - And Darla you say not talking about a law and that is not true,
      there are many places that require helmets and it is a rule or you cant
      ride - especially at barns run my show people, since most of them are good
      at showmanship but have no idea about horsemanship. I will put my
      horsemanship skills against any of you helmet lovers - helmets scream
      fear, insecurity, lack of confidence and lack of trust, all of which
      transfers to the horse. I don't have stats but I would bet if you listed
      all horse injuries, more would be from people wearing helmets than those
      that do not - because people will get a horse they should not with a
      helmet. When I was at Travis AFB, I saw 14 people leave in ambulance from
      horse injuries - all women, all wearing helmets. Never saw a rider that
      did not wear a helmet get hurt. Why? all the ones with helmets relied on
      the helmet and neglected their lack of skills and abilities since they had
      a helmet.<br />
      <br />
      I wish everyone that wanted to wear a helmet would wear it and shut up
      about others not wearing. I don't wear one and I don't try and wish
      everyone did not or make comments that everyone should not - I choose for
      me and think others should do the same. My opinion, I have lots of
      personal experience to back up my beliefs and opinions -

      <strong>Control Your Horse Not the World</strong><br />
      <br />
      It continues to amaze me that so many people try and control the world and
      the environment around their horse in attempt to feel in control and safe
      with their horse. Even if they temporarily succeed, it will not work every
      time.&nbsp; I see people who run around and try to prevent things from
      happening and try to prevent things from scaring their horses.&nbsp; These
      people run around and say do not drive the tractor when I ride, it scares
      my horse.&nbsp; Do not use a whip when I ride, it scares my horse.&nbsp;
      Do not run your horse because it makes my horse want to run.&nbsp; And one
      of my favorites, I can only ride alone since other horses scare my horse.
      When you hear someone say these things, a flag should go up. This is their
      fear talking, there is nothing wrong with their horse.<br />
      <br />
      I often wonder if these same people could stop planes from flying, cars
      from driving, people from walking and just stop the world so they can ride
      and think they are safer, would they do that as well?&nbsp; There is no
      way you can control everything that happens when you ride your horse, so
      people should stop trying.&nbsp; Work on controlling your horse, work on
      training your horse to respond to you, work on being a strong leader to
      your horse so he will not worry about every little thing that happens
      around him.&nbsp; Build confidence in your horse and yourself. I wonder if
      these same people run about on the highway telling everyone to slow down
      and if they see someone in the supermarket with 13 items in the 12 item
      lane, if they try and stop and correct that. People that try and control
      everything, are scared since they do not know what to if something happens
      they cannot control. All of this fear and insecurity runs down the reins
      to the horse.<br />
      <br />
      A horse needs fear to survive.&nbsp; It really is OK if your horse gets
      scared, in fact I think it is healthy for them.&nbsp; I better say that
      again in case some missed it. It is OK for your horse to get scared. It
      keeps them alert, keeps them paying attention and prevents them from
      becoming dull.&nbsp; If you really want to ride a completely safe horse
      that will not hurt you, ride the ones on the merry-go-round that go up and
      down.&nbsp; If you ride a real horse, then you need to accept the fact
      that they are strong, made of pure bone, muscle and instinctive emotion,
      and that they can never be completely controlled.&nbsp; No matter how big
      the bit, no matter how strong the tie down, no matter how strong the rider
      and no matter how much you try to control the world, a horse is never 100
      percent completely under control.&nbsp; I always say no matter how good or
      perfect your horse is, if a plane crashes in the field or arena where you
      are riding, your horse will react, spook and run off.&nbsp; Nothing you do
      can prevent this and you cannot train this out of a horse.&nbsp; If a bear
      rushes out of the woods while you are riding, your horse will run and will
      not care if you hang on or fall off.&nbsp; No bit will stop a horse when
      it is running for his life. If you are smart you will want to horse to run
      if a bear is after it.<br />
      <br />
      So, all you can do is improve your chances of surviving with good
      consistent training, good leadership, lots of practice and lots of
      confidence.&nbsp; How do you get confidence?&nbsp; By knowing and
      understanding your horse.&nbsp; You need to be aware of how your horse
      handles fear.&nbsp; If you spend your life trying to avoid scary things
      and protect your horse, then you will never learn to read your horse�s
      fear, you will never learn to help your horse through his fear and you
      will always be reacting to his fear, with your own fear.<br />
      <br />
      Sacking out is a term many in the horse world are either not familiar with
      or do not understand it.&nbsp; This is the most misunderstood and
      neglected part of horse training.&nbsp; It is so important to you and your
      horse, yet most �life long� horse owners do not do it, think it is not
      needed and do not understand it.&nbsp; A horse has to get scared to know
      it does not have to be scared.&nbsp; This is such an important step in
      horse training.&nbsp; By scaring your horse, under controlled conditions,
      you remove fear from your horse and teach a horse not to run, rear or
      panic instinctively when scared.&nbsp; By running around telling everyone
      else what NOT to do, so your horse will not get scared, only makes you
      neurotic and makes your horse more scared and creates less confidence in
      you.<br />
      <br />
      Research the term �Sacking out�, learn about it, understand it and apply
      it to your daily horse handling and training.&nbsp; I have a more detailed
      explanation and examples of this on my horsemanship page of my web
      site.&nbsp; Be aware that the old style of sacking out was cruel and was
      used to break the horse�s spirit.&nbsp; It has modified and improved over
      the years with more understanding of the horse, so do not be misled with
      bad information.&nbsp; When done properly, sacking out builds confidence
      in you and your horse, it removes fear, it teaches a horse that it is OK
      to get scared and then helps the horse deal with fear in other ways
      besides their instinctual reaction to run.&nbsp; It teaches you to read
      and respond appropriately to horse's fear, which builds confidence in you
      and your horse.<br />
      <br />
      Most people are already doing this without knowing it.&nbsp; Since sacking
      out is desensitizing a horse, most do this with a saddle, a lead rope,
      loading in a trailer, a loud jacket or other things that your horse has to
      accept in his daily life.&nbsp; Advanced desensitizing is dragging things,
      plastic bags, hobbles, ropes under the tail, coving the eyes and many
      other things.&nbsp; One of the most important things to remember when
      sacking out is that you are learning to read and observe your horse�s
      response to fear.&nbsp; You are learning how he gets scared, how he deals
      with it and when to intercede or get involved to help him find the correct
      response.&nbsp; The goal is to stop or reduce the fear before the horse
      reacts.&nbsp; Release teaches, so when you stop before the horse blows up,
      you teach the horse the right response is not to blow up.<br />
      <br />
      Sacking out is much more fun and beneficial than trying to control
      everyone and everything around your horse.&nbsp; The more you sack out,
      the more your horse will have confidence in you and you will have more
      confidence in your horse.&nbsp; With confidence comes trust, with trust
      comes better understanding and awareness of your horse and with that you
      get a better relationship with your horse.<br />

      <strong>Bite, Nip or Nuzzle? Start Trusting Your Horse</strong><br />
      <br />
      Is your horse biting, is he nipping or his he nuzzling?&nbsp; Knowing the
      difference can increase your relationship with your horse.&nbsp; I see
      lots and lots of people always pushing their horses away from them.&nbsp;
      �Respect my space� they call it.&nbsp; I hear life long horse owners
      telling new owners do not let you horse get too close, keep him out of
      your space, if you let a horse put his nose on you he can bite you.&nbsp;
      When I see this, I see horses that want to feel safe with their owner, who
      want to see their owner as a herd member, who want to show affection to
      their owner and then they get pushed, backed up, disciplined for �being in
      my space�.&nbsp; Stop this madness. A horse is not going to bite you if
      you let your horse get close. Beware of those that tell you otherwise.
      Watch any of my videos on Youtube and you see my horses all over me and
      they have never bit me. Why, because they know they should not.
      www.thinklikeahorse.org If you pay attention to your horse, if you read
      your horse and understand your horse, it is pretty easy to tell if he is
      being naughty or nice. A problem is many do not know the difference.&nbsp;
      Horses nuzzle each other in the herd; they show mutual respect to each
      other.&nbsp; They also sometimes nip each other and sometimes bite each
      other.&nbsp; It is all normal and natural horse behavior.&nbsp; It is true
      a horse can bite you anytime he wants.&nbsp; If he wants to bite you, you
      cannot stop him.&nbsp; You may think you can, you may think that you are
      so in control and that if you keep your horse �out of your space� then
      your horse will not bite you.&nbsp; Most horses do not bite without a
      reason. A horse that bites is biting for a lot more reasons that just
      being in your space. A horse will bite for protection, to show dominance,
      to play, to tease and to explore.&nbsp; Sometime a horse bites by accident
      when taking a treat.&nbsp; Not all bites are hard or forceful.&nbsp;
      However, most bites do hurt most people.&nbsp; If you make a choice to be
      around horses, then you make a choice to accept certain risks associated
      with horses.&nbsp; If you are around horses you can be stepped on, kicked,
      hit in the head, ran over, bit or struck.&nbsp; If you ride horses you can
      get bucked, thrown, dragged, ran into a fence post, head butted or fall
      off.&nbsp; All these things can happen to anyone at anytime.&nbsp; So if
      you choose to accept all these risks, then why are so many, so adamant
      that your horse can NEVER put his mouth or lips on you? Trust is a two-way
      street with horses.&nbsp; If you never trust your horse, he will never
      trust you.&nbsp; If you do not pick up his feet from fear of being kicked,
      your horse knows it.&nbsp; If you do not walk behind your horse or mess
      with his tail from fear of being kicked, your horse knows it.&nbsp; If you
      do not ride your horse or get on him bareback from fear of falling off,
      your horse knows it.&nbsp; If you do not work your horse from fear of
      making a mistake, your horse knows it.&nbsp; If you do not get close to
      your horse from fear of being stepped on, your horse knows it.
      &nbsp;Moreover, if you are always pushing your horse away from your face
      or pushing his mouth away from you from fear of being bit, your horse
      knows it. If you do not trust your horse, do not expect your horse to
      trust you. I let my horse nuzzle me, he searches me for treats, he licks
      the salt from my sweat off my face and he loves to feel the different
      types of clothes I wear with his muzzle.&nbsp; I think fleece is his
      favorite; he cannot stop wiggling his nose on fleece.&nbsp; I allow him to
      choose to bite me whenever he wants.&nbsp; I know he will not because I
      trust him, he trust me and we understand each other.&nbsp; He has no
      reason to bite me, since I give him no reason to bite me.&nbsp; He knows
      and I know I am his leader, I am the head horse and he cannot disrespect
      me or show dominance over me.&nbsp; He knows this since I show him every
      time we are together or if he forgets.&nbsp; I address each act of
      dominance with the appropriate level of direction.&nbsp; I teach him that
      he cannot push me, he cannot move me, he cannot test me and cannot move up
      (higher in the herd) over me.&nbsp; Since I am consistent, since I make
      the rules clear and easy to follow, he knows them well.&nbsp; I think our
      relationship is better because of this.&nbsp; Horses need direction not
      correction.&nbsp; Prevention is always better then treatment.&nbsp;
      Consistency is your horse�s best teacher and inconsistency is his worst
      enemy. I really wish more people would reconsider the long honored
      position of �never let your horse put his nose or mouth on you�.&nbsp;
      Trust your horse, learn to read your horse, bond with your horse and let
      him know that you understand him enough to trust him not to bite
      you.&nbsp; Do not try to prevent him from biting you; help him learn that
      biting is not allowed.&nbsp; He may try to nip you to see if he can,
      correct it, show him that is not allowed, help him learn and teach him as
      his leader.&nbsp; The more you trust him, the more he will trust you and
      trust is the building block of a better relationship with your horse. So
      go give your horse a hug, give him a nose to nose nuzzle, let him show you
      that he will not bite you and that you can trust him to trust you. Happy

      <strong>Why Men are More Successful with Horses</strong><br />
      <br />
      Holy cow, I bet I got more jumps to judgment on this title than a horse
      with a cactus under his saddle.&nbsp; Easy ladies, hear my out and you
      might even agree with what I have to say.<br />
      <br />
      Let me start with what a few of you are thinking.&nbsp; Where does this
      guy get off thinking some sexist thing like men are better with
      horses?&nbsp; Some time we all tend to jump to conclusions, even with our
      horses.&nbsp; A horse may accidentally step on us and we take it as a
      personal attack or insult.&nbsp; A horse may not feel good and be
      lethargic and we call them lazy, disrespectful or blame them for not
      paying attention.&nbsp; Horses teach up patience and if we forget that,
      they teach us a lesson.<br />
      <br />
      Now back to men and women with horses.&nbsp; Men and women are different,
      that should be no surprise and most would agree on this point. Ying and
      Yang in all things, I discuss this on my site.&nbsp; Men tend to be more
      stringent, tougher and less forgiving.&nbsp; Women tend to be more
      flexible, not so ego driven tough and more forgiving.&nbsp; Men tend to be
      disciplinarians and enforcers, while women tend to be more willing to give
      additional chances and not as quick to discipline.&nbsp; Men tend to be
      stronger than women are and are more willing to use their muscles, where
      women tend to find other ways to get results other than brute force.&nbsp;
      Both have situations when their specific traits are useful and better for
      the specific task or circumstance.&nbsp; I know these are not absolutes,
      but generally, these tend to hold true.<br />
      <br />
      Horses like direction, they like consistency, they like knowing the rules
      and having the rules clearly defined.&nbsp; Horses respect dominant
      leaders and in fact, if they are not dominated they will see it as
      weakness, take advantage of you, treat you like a lower horse and try to
      move upwards in the pecking order.&nbsp; Horses are tougher than humans
      and live differently than humans. Horses give out strict and consistent
      discipline to other horses.&nbsp; Horses are enforcers when it comes to
      their hierarchy, social structure and pecking order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Horses do
      not allow transgressions without enforcement and a response.&nbsp; A horse
      will NOT say, �Oh, that�s ok, I know you did not mean to do that, I will
      let it go since I know it was an accident.�&nbsp; Horses pay attention and
      expect other horses to pay attention.&nbsp; If you do not pay attention
      and impose or invade on a higher horse and miss a signal to back off and
      you do not show the proper respect, you will be kicked or bitten.&nbsp; If
      a horse kicks you, it is not personal it is just the rules.&nbsp; You will
      NOT be kicked softly to give you a chance, you will NOT be kicked lightly,
      you will NOT be pushed away kindly with a hoof� you will be kicked hard
      and fast because those are rules. If you take a horse lesson personal, you
      miss the lesson.<br />

      You can read about herd behavior and hierarchy on my Horsemanship page of
      my site:<br />
      <br />
      If you look at horses and their way of life, they are closer related to
      the way men are rather than the way women are.&nbsp; Since men tend to get
      aggressive, strict or forceful quicker than many women, a horse responds
      better and see that as clearer.&nbsp; Most men tend to be more specific
      and less flexible, some may say stubborn or macho, so they are quicker to
      correct than a lot of women.&nbsp; Whereas women are more likely to give a
      second, third or a fourth chance before giving out discipline, women tend
      to have more patience than men do and are less likely to resort to
      physical or aggressive discipline.&nbsp; This is good for teaching horses
      certain things, but can be counter-productive for day-to-day handling of a
      horse. I say it all the time, when working with men I have to say ease up
      and do not be so aggressive and with working with women I have to say get
      tougher and be more aggressive.<br />
      <br />
      Women have been a big part in getting �Natural Horsemanship� to take
      off.&nbsp; Natural Horsemanship is kinder, gentler and better for the
      horse.&nbsp; It also takes more time, more patience and a better
      understanding of the horse.&nbsp; This is why women tend to be better with
      Natural Horsemanship techniques and men are more resistant to accepting
      it.&nbsp; Women traits help them succeed better in Natural Horsemanship
      verse the old way of force, fear and intimidation.&nbsp; However, with
      that said, force, fear and intimidation works with horses and normally
      works faster.&nbsp; I am not promoting meanness or encouraging it, but the
      fact is it works.&nbsp; Aggression tends to work faster, takes less time
      and gets results.&nbsp; I always hear if Natural Horsemanship is so much
      better, why would anyone use the old ways?&nbsp; It is really simple, the
      old ways work, they worked for many years, they work faster and they get
      results, not necessarily better results but results.&nbsp; Easy now, I
      absolutely still think the old ways are not as good as Natural
      Horsemanship.&nbsp; The old ways may get results, but it destroys the
      spirit of the horse, it tears down trust, it is much harder and tougher on
      the horse and you do not get as good of a horse as you can with Natural
      Horsemanship. I say it all the time, the slow way is the fast way with
      horses. Natural Horsemanship is slower than the old ways.<br />
      <br />
      So why would anyone use the old ways?&nbsp; Time and lack of knowledge are
      the two main reasons.&nbsp; The old ways are faster and you do not need to
      know as much or understand the horse.&nbsp; If you beat a horse or
      intimidate a horse enough, you can get it to do just about anything and
      never worry about understanding a horse or worry about working with the
      horse.&nbsp; If you just want fast results, so you can use the horse for
      work faster, the old way is better.&nbsp; Which is why I have a problem
      with trainers who claim to be Natural Horseman and then use the old ways
      to get fast results in less time and unless the client is there during the
      training, they will not find out until it is too late.&nbsp; The old ways
      work better for men since they can use force, strength and
      aggression.&nbsp; These ways are not as easy for a woman to use, so they
      tend to do better with Natural Horsemanship.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, if you can get aggressive, you really do not have to know
      as much about a horse, to get results.&nbsp; The problem is, if you do not
      know much about a horse and cannot get aggressive, then you will not be
      very successful with horses.&nbsp; If you are NOT going to be able to
      depend on aggressiveness, strength and the old ways, you really have to
      know much more about a horse and have a much better understanding of the
      horse, in order to get results. Natural Horsemanship is just being nice
      and never correcting a horse. This is a big misconception in the horse
      world.<br />
      <br />
      The statistics say about 80% of all horse owners are women.&nbsp; I hear
      and see the same thing all too often.&nbsp; Women who mean well, who try
      hard, who want to be successful, who love horses and give great care to
      their horses, but they are not successful.&nbsp; They struggle, get
      frustrated, hire trainer after trainer, sell and buy horses and just do
      not seem to be successful with their horse. Then they justify or
      rationalize their failure by blaming the horse, the breed, the trainer,
      the equipment and everything but they never look in the mirror.&nbsp; To
      me, when people fail with a horse, it comes down to them not willing to
      get aggressive, not willing to be dominant, and not having the inability
      to get tough and be consistent. This lack of willingness is either fear or
      inability.&nbsp; When people fail, they give carrots, they try to talk to
      the horse, they continue to try to give the horse chances, they accept
      less than what they want, get frustrated and think they are being kind and
      loving to their horse.&nbsp; In fact, this behavior confuses horses, the
      horse sees this as inconsistency and it creates a lack of respect from the
      horse.<br />
      <br />
      So why do I think men tend to be more successful with horses, because they
      don�t have to be as smart (I know all you women will love this point), men
      are willing to use aggression and force quicker and they are more dominant
      and more likely to discipline.&nbsp; That works with a horse, not because
      it is better, but because it works and horses understand it. It works
      since it is the way of the herd communicates and it is the same way horses
      treat each other.&nbsp; If you have ever seen a mare correct her foal, it
      is not pretty, it is aggressive, hard and overdone in my book, but it is
      their way.&nbsp; A mare will bite a foal so hard in the back that it will
      drive it to the ground almost smashing it to the ground buckling the
      foal�s legs.&nbsp; The foal will immediately get up and run back to mom
      and stay right next to her showing extremely submissive behavior.&nbsp;
      Not a lot of words or begging in a herd, no offering of carrots, maybe a
      couple of warnings and then it is �action� time.<br />
      <br />
      I guess the moral to this is, if you do not want to use force, fear,
      intimidation or aggression, you better be willing to learn 10 times as
      much about the horse and horse behavior and have a much better
      understanding of the horse.&nbsp; You have to be willing to study and
      educate yourself, so the need for the old ways are not needed.&nbsp; You
      need to know that sometime you will have to get tough, dominate a horse
      and make them see you as a strong leader.&nbsp; It you are never willing
      to discipline and you believe that all horse problems can be corrected
      with a carrot, love, threats, words and other non-herd things, then I
      believe your odds of succeeding with horse will be low.<br />
      <br />
      The horse is never wrong; they want and need direction. They need
      consistency so they know what is expected and know what the right answer
      is and know who the smartest and strongest leader is.&nbsp; You help a
      horse by being consistent, knowledgeable, fair and making sure there is
      only one right answer for the release and by making that right answer easy
      for the horse to find.<br />
      <br />
      I hope everyone got something out of this article. Maybe now you have a
      little better understanding of how a horse thinks and how a horse sees
      their world. Happy Trails,<br />

      <strong>Horse Training Sayings - What they Mean</strong><br />
      <br />
      If you read about horse training, articles, books or talk with people
      about horses, they will commonly say things that may sound like double
      talk, cute sayings or fancy horse talk, some will say.&nbsp; There are
      many old horse sayings about horses and training and they are used
      frequently, but not really understood.&nbsp; If you do not know what they
      mean, you probably do not know the importance of their meaning.&nbsp; I
      have listed a few here, some of them you may have heard, some maybe
      not.&nbsp; However, if you hear them in the future, you will have a better
      understanding of what they mean, hopefully understand their importance and
      will be able to apply them better to help you and your horse.&nbsp; If you
      learn to understand these, you will understand horses better and can apply
      these to make yourself better.&nbsp; You will understand why it is so
      important for you to get better by the end of this article.<br />
      <br />
      You find more horse saying on my Cowboy Wisdom Page of my site:<br />
      <br />
      All of these sayings are interconnected and all affect each other. If you
      can imagine a spider web and piece of the web is one of these sayings,
      then you see how each one makes the other ones stronger and more
      effective.<br />
      <br />
      So let�s take a look at some old horse training sayings and try and apply
      some deeper meaning to them besides just the words.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�The Slow Way is the Fast Way with horses�:&nbsp;</strong> This is
      critical in any horse handling.&nbsp; If you rush something, if you get in
      a hurry, you increase the chance of a wreck, you set the horse up to fail
      and since you did not take the time it takes, it will take more time.
      &nbsp;If you teach the horse small steps, allow small successes, give
      release for those successes, always rewarding (release) for the smallest
      try.&nbsp; By doing this you help the horse know what to expect and the
      horse will know what is going to happen before it happens.&nbsp; Knowing
      this makes the horse feel safe and establishes a routine and trust.&nbsp;
      By going slow you limit confusion, you give the horse time to understand
      what you want, what you are asking for and you help the horse find the
      right answer.&nbsp; If you don�t rush training, the horse will learn
      faster.&nbsp; Horses find comfort in knowing what to expect, they don�t
      like surprises and they like routine.&nbsp; Going slow makes us better and
      when we get better our horses get better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >"If you get better, your horse gets better":&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong
      >Work on yourself more and not the horse.&nbsp; If you get better
      communicating and understanding horse, your horse will reflect that. When
      you are giving good direction and leadership your horse will do better, a
      horse is a reflection of you, if you do it right, your horse does
      right.&nbsp; If you ask the question right, the horse will give you the
      right answer.&nbsp; When you work on yourself, you accept responsibility
      for what you cause the horse to do, you get better and your horse will get
      better, since a horse is never wrong and it is never the horse�s fault.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >"It is never the horse's fault" or �The horse is never
        wrong�:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong
      >
      A horse is a reflection of the person handling him, if the horse fails you
      failed, if the horse does something wrong, you did something wrong, when
      you stop blaming the horse, looking for excuses, you look to yourself for
      the problem, therefore you will work on yourself, you will get better and
      your horse will get better.&nbsp; If you accept wrong or bad results as
      your fault, you will be more willing to change what you are doing and if
      you want change in a horse, you must first change.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�In order for your horse to change, you must first
        change�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      Since a horse is only a reflection of you, if you do good, your horse will
      do good and if you do bad, your horse will do bad.&nbsp; You must be able
      to recognize and accept this so you will change what you do, when
      something is not working. If you blame the horse when things go wrong, you
      will never change what you do and your horse will never change what it
      does.&nbsp; Then the cycle continues and the horse suffers.&nbsp;
      Admitting that you cause all actions from a horse you handle, gives you
      the ability to know that you must change in order to get your horse to
      change.&nbsp; If you always do what you have always done, you will always
      get what you have always got.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�If you take the time is takes, it will take less time�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      By going slow, since the slow way is the fast way, you take more time by
      slowing down, doing it right and the end result will come faster than if
      you get in a hurry and confuse the horse.&nbsp; Confusion will cause a
      wreck and that will create fear and destroy trust.&nbsp; When you lose
      trust it will take twice as long to get results, since you will have to
      undo all the wrong you did when you tried to do it in a hurry.&nbsp;
      Therefore, when you do better your horse does better.&nbsp; Since the
      horse is never wrong, you set the horse up to fail when you get in a hurry
      and it takes more time since you end up doing over and over again.<br />
      <br />
      �Set the horse up to succeed and don�t lead him down a path to
      fail�:&nbsp; This means don�t just try things and see if they work since
      most of the time they will not work. If you do not know what you want or
      what the right answer is, how can help the horse find the right answer?
      When you try, the horse will fail since you did not take the time it takes
      and do slow proper steps so the horse can learn the right answer.&nbsp; If
      you plan, think like a horse, then you will break the training down into
      small steps, small successes, so you can teach the horse what to expect,
      lead the horse right where you want him to go, so he can find the right
      answer.&nbsp; By giving good direction, you help the horse find the right
      answer and avoid correction. That is why direction is always better than
      correction.&nbsp; When we help our horse succeed, we get better and when
      that happens our horse gets better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�Listen to the horse or The horse is the best teacher of the
        horse�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      Everyone wants to train a horse, everyone wants to make their horse
      better, everyone is always so busy trying to make their horse learn or do
      something and they rarely take time to listen to the horse.&nbsp; A horse
      will tell you if you do something right or wrong.&nbsp; They will tell you
      if something works or does not work.&nbsp; They will scream this with
      confusion and wrong responses and all too often no one hears them and no
      one listens. An example of this is reaching too fast to pet a horse and
      the horse moves away. People that don�t know will the horse is head shy,
      people that know will change what they do, move slower and will help the
      horse not move away, so the horse can learn the right answer. When a horse
      tells you something and you ignore him, he will not trust you, he will
      know that you do not understand him, he will know that he can�t trust you
      since you do not speak his language.&nbsp; Watch and listen to the horse,
      the horse is never wrong and they always tell you what works and what does
      not work.&nbsp; The horse is the best teacher of the horse.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�A horse has to get scared so it knows it does not have to be
        scared�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      If you think like a horse, this one is easy.&nbsp; A plastic bag blows by,
      a horse snorts, jumps and prepares to run or runs off.&nbsp; We know it is
      only a bag and will not hurt a horse, but a horse has to get scared, this
      fear is what has kept them alive for thousands of years.&nbsp; You cannot
      take that out of them.&nbsp; So understanding this, we know that all
      horses get scared, we get scared, and we need to help horse deal with
      their fear a different way.&nbsp; We need to teach them that is OK to be
      scared, but they can�t react like a wild flight animal when scared.&nbsp;
      We need to help them see that fear is normal, not all fear will kill them,
      and they do not have to run when scared.&nbsp; We cannot do this if we try
      and avoid scary things, if we beat them, or we scare them more and cause
      pain when they get scared.&nbsp; We have to let the horse get scared and
      show them that it will not be hurt, show them trust and we will help them
      deal with their fear, by being a strong and confident leader who gives
      good direction and not correction.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Direction is better than correction�:&nbsp;</strong> If you pay
      attention, if you give continuous feedback to the horse and if you make
      sure the horse knows what to expect, he will be less likely to make a
      mistake.&nbsp; By giving good consistent direction, you help the horse
      find the right answer and prevent if from making a mistake, which means
      you prevent having to correct mistakes.&nbsp; When your horse fails you
      fail, if you do not pay attention and you allow your horse to get into
      trouble or make mistakes, then you have to correct those mistakes.
      However, if you are active, paying attention and giving good direction,
      you avoid corrections.&nbsp; This is better for the horse and better for
      your relationship with your horse.&nbsp; So when someone is constantly
      correcting their horse, they are not giving good direction.&nbsp; Which
      means they do not know what they are doing and they are not giving good
      direction, getting better, or paying attention to what the horse is
      telling them?&nbsp; Which is why when you get better, your horse gets
      better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Trust your horse and your horse will trust you�:&nbsp;</strong>
      This is a big one that is far too common.&nbsp; Horses are big, strong,
      fast and reactionary animals.&nbsp; It is easy and reasonable to have some
      concern when you do not understand them.&nbsp; Fear is crippling to having
      your horse trust you. &nbsp;Horses know they are food for others, they are
      hyper alert and extremely sensitive, they have to be alert to stay alive,
      so they do not miss anything and they know what is going to happen before
      it happens. &nbsp;Therefore, when you think you fool a horse, when you
      think you can act not scared and the horse will not know it, you are
      wrong.&nbsp; Your fear only increases their fear.&nbsp; Your fear shows
      you as not confident, your fear says you are not a good leader and not
      someone a horse wants to put his trust/life in.&nbsp; You see it all the
      time, someone is scared of horses and they try to act tough, they try and
      cover their fear, they try and fool the horse and they really only fool
      themselves.&nbsp; These are the most dangerous people to be around and
      work with.&nbsp; They do not listen, they do not think, they do not learn,
      they are paralyzed by their fear, which comes from a lack of confidence,
      lack of knowledge and lack of trust and then they expect their horse to
      trust them and believe in them, when all the time they are lying to
      themselves, others and the horse.&nbsp; A horse will not trust you if he
      fears you and you scream loud and clear that you do not trust a horse
      since you fear them.&nbsp; Fear gets more people and horses hurt than just
      about any other thing.&nbsp; Yet a majority of older horse owners are
      scared to death of getting hurt and in all their wisdom they pick horse
      ownership thinking it will get them over their fear, when in reality all
      it really does is set the horse up to fail.&nbsp; When your horse fails,
      you failed.&nbsp; You cannot succeed with horses if you fear them. You
      will never see a good horseman scared or nervous of horses.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Most horse problems are really people problems�:&nbsp;</strong>
      Since a horse does fine in the wild where no people are around and since
      horses only have problems when people are involved, it only goes to reason
      that horse problems are caused by people.&nbsp; There is no wrong or right
      in the wild, there is only survival.&nbsp; So when we put horses in
      domesticated environments, nail metal to their feet, box them up, isolate
      them, ride them in pain bits and keep them in unnatural environments, they
      develop problems, none of which they had before we (people) got involved.
      Everything a horse does, every situation a horse is put in, every time a
      horse gets hurt, panics and runs or does some other natural horse thing,
      people want to blame the horse and not accept that they caused or set up
      what happened.&nbsp; With that mindset, people never change what they do,
      since they blame the horse and don�t understand that they cause every
      thing that happens with a horse, which why a horse is only a reflection of
      what you do and if you want your horse to change you must first
      change.&nbsp; Once you accept this, you change and you get better and so
      your horse gets better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�It will always get worst right before it gets better�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      When pushing horses past their limit, when trying to un-teach bad learned
      behavior, some horses can be very resistant, some will have learned this
      so well that they are unwilling or unable to change.&nbsp; They have been
      made stubborn, resistant, stiff or dangerous, and they have learned the
      lesson well. Bad horses are not born they are made.&nbsp; So these horses
      can have the toughest problems to fix (help the horse).&nbsp; It is still
      never the horse�s fault, but since a horse will fight some things, if they
      were pushed too fast or abused in the past or are more fear driven because
      of bad handling, or some studs or stallions are very strong willed and all
      of this can be tough to overcome.&nbsp; So this saying, it will always get
      worst right before it gets better means some horses will fight their
      hardest, resist their most, right before they give in. It is like a last
      ditch effort to survive, resist or get freedom.&nbsp; Therefore, it will
      appear to get worse and then after that final effort, many horses will
      submit right after their last strong fight.&nbsp; This can happen in many
      training areas and we should not be fighting with horses, but I think that
      is where this got started and it has continued over time.&nbsp; The key
      is, stay focused, do not give up, insist on only one right answer and
      continue pressure until you get it, no matter how bad it gets.&nbsp; Just
      when you think it is getting worse it suddenly gets better.&nbsp; If it
      does not, it is never the horse�s fault.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�A horse is only a refection of the rider�:&nbsp;</strong> This is
      more of the same, if you do good your horse will do good, if you do bad,
      or go too fast, or do not listen to your horse, your horse will get
      confused, do bad or fail (not find the right answer).&nbsp; Since it is
      never the horse�s fault, you make a horse do all bad or all good.&nbsp; If
      you change what you do, the horse will change what it does.&nbsp; Listen
      to your horse, it will always tell you if you are doing something right or
      wrong, simply look at his response.&nbsp; If I raise my hand and my horse
      runs off, I caused my horse to run off, depending on what I wanted I will
      assign right or wrong.&nbsp; If I point and ask my horse to move and the
      horse moves, then I did it right, since my horse did it right. All things
      come back to what you do and what the horse does.&nbsp; Since a horse is
      only a reflection of the rider, when you hear someone call their horse
      stupid, look at them and say look in the mirror.&nbsp; If they call their
      horse crazy, tell them to look in the mirror.&nbsp; If they have a good
      horse, they are good.&nbsp; If they have a scared horse, then they are
      scared, if they have a horse that fights, then they fight.&nbsp; All
      horses do what they do because of what is done to them.&nbsp; Bad horses
      are not born, they are made.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Bad horses are never born, they are made�:&nbsp;</strong> All
      horses are born a horse, knowing nothing but instincts, survival and they
      are just horses.&nbsp; From that moment on all interactions with humans
      will either teach good or bad.&nbsp; Depending on the handling, all horses
      can be either good or bad.&nbsp; However, there are many bad horses that
      were made and now they are labeled. &nbsp;Which is why so many horses have
      a past (bad handling) and no future.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Release teaches or A horse learns on the release�:&nbsp;</strong>
      Horse hate pressure, they are comfort seeking animals; they avoid stress,
      danger and threats (pressure).&nbsp; A horse will always choose easy over
      hard, it will walk rather than run, it will avoid conflict and seek
      comfort.&nbsp; A horse looks for release from pressure or release from
      being uncomfortable.&nbsp; Therefore, by making the right thing easy and
      the wrong thing hard, we use the horse�s natural instinct to seek comfort
      and avoid pressure and this helps the horse find the right answer.&nbsp;
      So stopping or releasing the pressure or discomfort, we tell the horse
      what the right answer is.&nbsp; Release with bad timing does not work and
      only teaches the wrong thing, but understanding how important release is
      and what it teaches enables us to better communicate with our horses in a
      language they can understand.&nbsp; If you do not understand how release
      teaches, you cannot talk horse and the horse will know it before it
      happens.&nbsp; Rearing horses are a great example, when people do not
      understand release and a horse rears, most people will stop what they are
      doing and move away from the horse so they do not get hurt. Therefore, by
      giving release (move away and stopping) the horse thinks and learns, by
      rearing I get release, therefore rearing is the right answer, to stop
      pressure. Soon he knows that when he rears, you will stop pressure and
      then he knows what is going to happen, before it happens.<br />

      Horses are �Kings� of observation and they miss nothing and see
      everything.&nbsp; You cannot fool them or fake them, they know if you know
      and they know if you do not know.&nbsp; They are exceptional
      observers.&nbsp; They know because their lives depend on it.&nbsp; If they
      miss something, they know they will be dead, that is powerful motivation
      and that is why they are so good at it.&nbsp; Horses keep you honest,
      since they know if you are lying or trying to fool them.&nbsp; They know
      if you are scared and do not trust them and they will not trust you.&nbsp;
      They read and see the slightest change in your stance, you mood, your
      intentions, your thoughts, where you look and if you think you can fool
      them, they will set you straight ever time.&nbsp; So be aware, a horse
      knows what is going to happen before it happens.&nbsp; If you listen to
      the horse they will tell you they know and they will keep you honest, by
      not allowing you lie or fool them.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Horses never lie or Horses keep you honest�:&nbsp;</strong>
      Horses do not know how to lie, they do what they do from instincts and
      because of what happens around them.&nbsp; They are reactionary animals
      and have to be taught how to respond with control.&nbsp; When a horse
      kicks another horse, it is not from meanness, it is not from planning, it
      is from truth.&nbsp; A kick is pure with no malice or ill intent.&nbsp;
      When a horse kicks it does so to teach or to protect or from fear.&nbsp;
      So punishing a horse does not work, they do not understand it.&nbsp; Since
      a horse knows what is going to happen before it happens, they cannot be
      fooled or tricked and when you try they know it.&nbsp; When they see that
      you are being sneaky and not honest, they will not trust you.&nbsp; When
      you are honest, your horse finds comfort and responds with trust.&nbsp;
      When you try to fool them they will tell you that you did it wrong.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Your horse will tell you when you do it right�:&nbsp;</strong>
      This goes back to listening to your horse.&nbsp; If you do something
      wrong, too fast or too aggressive the horse will tell you, if you listen
      and watch.&nbsp; Pay more attention to what your horse does after you do
      something.&nbsp; Then you will know what works and what does not
      work.&nbsp; You will see when you go too fast or when you make a mistake,
      the horse will tell you, if you listen and watch.&nbsp; Then you can
      change what you do so the horse will change what it does.&nbsp; If you do
      the same thing, you will get the same results.&nbsp; If you always do what
      you have always done, you will always get what you have always got.&nbsp;
      If you get success, keep doing what you do.&nbsp; If you get failure,
      change what you do. &nbsp;This makes you better so your horse will get
      better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�Predicting a horse�s response is better than reacting to his
        response�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      This comes with knowledge and understanding of horses.&nbsp; If you take
      the time it takes, do small steps and set the horse up for success, you
      will be able to predict what the horse will do.&nbsp; Prediction is better
      than reaction. This forces you to know the right answer and forces you to
      give specific direction to get that right answer. Then you can teach the
      horse with less stress and confusion and you give good direction and not
      correction.&nbsp; The horse learns faster when you go slower.&nbsp; The
      slow way is the fast way. By knowing what you do and what the horse will
      do helps you predict behavior (good and bad).&nbsp; That way you can
      change what you do so your horse will change what it does.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�If you fail, your horse fails�:&nbsp;</strong> When we do
      something wrong, our horse does something wrong.&nbsp; If you do not pay
      attention and you allow your horse to get into trouble you will have to
      correct the horse.&nbsp; If you do well, your horse does well.&nbsp; If
      you allow your horse to fail, then you fail.&nbsp; If you do badly, your
      horse does badly.&nbsp; Since a horse is only a reflection of the person
      handling it, if you succeed, your horse succeeds and if you fail, your
      horse fails. &nbsp;It is never the horse�s fault.&nbsp; When you get
      better, your horse gets better.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >"If you get the wrong answer, you asked the question
        wrong":&nbsp;</strong
      >
      Look to yourself for the problem, help the horse find the right answer by
      eliminating the wrong options.&nbsp; If I want a horse to trot and he
      walks, I have not been clear, I must have given the wrong direction, the
      horse is telling me he is confused or does not know what I want and now I
      have to change what I do or give correction.&nbsp; Since direction is
      better than correction, I failed so I made my horse failed.&nbsp; If I ask
      right, if I am clear and consistent, if I set the horse up to succeed, the
      horse will answer right.&nbsp; It is never the horse�s fault and if I do
      good the horse will do good and if I fail the horse fails, so if I get the
      wrong answer, I asked the question wrong.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >"Make the wrong thing hard and the right thing easy": &nbsp;</strong
      >
      Horse are comfort seeking animals, they avoid stress, danger and
      pressure.&nbsp; A horse will avoid conflict and seek comfort.&nbsp; A
      horse searches for the easy way (we have to make right thing easy).&nbsp;
      Therefore, by making the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard, we use
      the horse�s natural instinct to seek comfort and avoid pressure to help
      the horse find the right answer. A horse only gets release of pressure or
      comfort when he gives the right answer. &nbsp;By keeping the pressure up,
      making it hard and making the horse uncomfortable, the horse will keep
      looking for comfort or release (the right answer) and when he finds it,
      you release pressure and the horse now knows that is right answer.&nbsp;
      Which is why you have to know what the right answer is, and you must know
      that you only release pressure when you get that right answer.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Green on Green equals Black and Blue�:&nbsp;</strong> A truer
      saying was never said.&nbsp; This means that when a green rider gets a
      green horse they will make mistakes, be thrown or hurt and will have many
      bruises.&nbsp; The term �Green� means young and inexperience.&nbsp; Now
      this term is relative since many older riders think they are not green
      since they rode a horse as a kid.&nbsp; A lot people get back into horses
      later in life and think they can jump right back in the saddle after 15 or
      30 years off.&nbsp; They are wrong and they soon realize the bruises come
      much easier later in life.&nbsp; A partner of this saying is:&nbsp; Young
      troopers need old horses.&nbsp; This means inexperience riders need an
      older horse that has lots of experience and has learned many lessons so it
      will be less likely to hurt an inexperienced rider and less likely to be
      confused by the inexperienced.&nbsp; Young horses need experienced good
      riders to the horse can learn the right answers. You would not have a
      third grader teach other third graders math. If you did, neither would
      learn, both would make mistakes that neither one would know were mistakes
      and both would learn wrong things thinking they are right, while all the
      time neither would know the difference.&nbsp; That is green on green in a
      nutshell.<br />
      <br />
      <strong
        >�A horse does what it does, because you do what you do�:&nbsp;</strong
      >
      A horse is only a reflection of you and what you do.&nbsp; That is why it
      can never be the horse�s fault.&nbsp; If you do it right, the horse will
      do it right. If you get the wrong answer, you asked the wrong way.
      &nbsp;If you get better, your horse gets better and the horse will do
      right since you do right.&nbsp; You cause every thing when you handle a
      horse.&nbsp; You either cause what you want (right) or what you don�t want
      (wrong).&nbsp; Which is why, it is never the horse�s fault.<br />
      <br />
      And last but not least and my personal favorite;<br />
      <br />
      <strong>�Think like a Horse�:&nbsp;</strong> In order to think like a
      horse, you have to understand how a horse thinks and lives.&nbsp; You have
      to be able to see the world as a horse sees it, through a horse�s eyes,
      with all their instincts, fear, flight response, their vision, the
      placement of their eyes for surround vision, what it is like to live as
      food for others, knowing that their best defense is their speed to flee,
      understanding their language, their herd behavior and actually being able
      to know how a horse learns, feels and lives.&nbsp; Only then can you
      approach things as if you were a horse and only then will you know how not
      to confuse them, not to judge or blame them and realize that they are
      nothing more than a reflection of you and what you do.&nbsp; Then you can
      understand why it is never their fault, why they know what is going to
      happen before it happens, why the slow way is the fast way, why when you
      get better your horse gets better and why the more you think like a horse,
      the more the horse will trust you, see you as a leader and will know that
      you know.<br />
      <br />
      Therefore, if you read, live and breathe these saying, if you understand
      these sayings, you can apply them to most situations when dealing with
      horses.&nbsp; You will see crashes, wrecks, horses get hurt and people get
      hurt all the time and if you critically evaluate the situation and analyze
      what happened, you can probably apply one or more of these sayings that
      were not followed.&nbsp; You will see that had people applied these saying
      and understood them, the wreck could have been avoided.<br />
      <br />
      You will notice that a lot of these sayings connect to each other like a
      web and all have a common theme.&nbsp; Many of the sayings are used to
      describe other sayings.&nbsp; They are all connected and they all put us
      closer to thinking like a horse. &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the more we do
      that, the more we will understand a horse and be able to listen to the
      horse.&nbsp; The more we understand a horse, the more we will communicate
      with them from their perspective and not ours, the more we will understand
      why they do what they do and how we can help them.&nbsp; The better we get
      we can learn from them and we can help them deal with their fears and
      instincts through mutual understanding and respect.&nbsp; In addition, our
      journey to higher learning with horses are improved and advanced.&nbsp;
      Then we get better and when that happens� well you know the rest.<br />

      <strong>Horses Spook Less at High Noon � Ever Wonder Why?</strong><br />
      <br />
      The title is meant to get you thinking. Why is the title of this article
      true? If you think about what happens at high noon you will find many
      reasons on why this is correct. When the sun is at the highest point,
      normally about noon, the light is coming from directly above. When light
      comes from above it tends to cast less shadows. Light from above tends to
      create even light. When there are fewer shadows, the horse is able to see
      more clearly.<br />
      <br />
      Horses see shades and shadows so when there is more even light from above,
      the horse sees better, and is more comfortable. When a horse is more
      comfortable it feels safer. When a horse feels safer, they are less likely
      to spook and react. All things are connect to other things when dealing
      with horses. You can read more about how a horse�s vision works on my web
      site at this link:
      <a href="index-3.html#30"
        ><u>http://www.thinklikeahorse.org/index-3.html#30</u></a
      ><br />
      <br />
      When a rider is more comfortable, the horse is more comfortable. When a
      rider sees more, the rider can give better direction to the horse. All
      these things make a horse less likely to spook. Of course, there are many
      other things that help a horse feel confident and not spook. Things like
      sacking out, desensitizing, exposure to scary things, pushing a horse past
      their fear, doing new things with a horse to build his confidence and
      strength. When a horse is in shape, he feels better carrying a rider. When
      a rider is in shape, has good balance and stays out of the way of the
      horse, the horse feels better. Conversely, if a rider is new, scared,
      unbalanced, has loud hands and are constantly pulling on the horse�s head,
      then the horse cannot relax or get comfortable. This puts more pressure
      and stress on the horse, so the horse is NOT comfortable, is uneasy, and
      is more ready for something to spook at or ready to react.<br />
      <br />
      Loose reins are another thing that helps a horse not spook. A horse needs
      to move his head up and down so it can see and adjust to different objects
      that are close, far, in the shade or in the sunlight. When a horse is
      allowed to use his head without restrictions, the horse feels better. Then
      the horse feels safer and more confident and that means it is less likely
      to spook.<br />
      <br />
      Another side of this is if a horse is less likely to spook at high noon
      then it is more likely to spook at sunrise or sunset. Why is that? When
      the sun is low, it creates more shadows, longer and larger shadows. During
      sunset or sunrise, the sun is directly in the line of sight of the horse�s
      eyes, that creates glare and sun wash out, so the horse has a hard time
      seeing and focusing on objects. This makes a horse more uncomfortable
      since it cannot see as well and more likely to spook. Horses do not close
      their eyes when the sun is in it, they do not have a sun visor or hat to
      give them so shade so they can see without straining. They do not have
      sunglasses to block out glare. All of these factors make it harder for a
      horse to see and that makes a horse more likely to spook.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <center>
      Good clear vision = confident and less stressed horses<br />
      Poor vision, shades shadows, sun glare = fear, stress, less ability to
      see, cannot relax and feel safe
    </center>
    <br />
    <br />
    Remember, your job as a horseman is to make things better and easier for the
    horse. Your understanding of horses, your balance, you awareness, you
    ability to be an easy comfortable load for the horse all help the horse feel
    safer and more confident. That makes it easier for a horse to know and find
    the right answer and increases your communication with horse. All of these
    things may seem minor, but when added together really helps your horse.
    Always look at a horse with the attitude of why did my horse do that, how I
    did contribute to it, how could I have done better and made it easier for
    the horse. That is the attitude of good horsemanship.<br />
    <br />
    Let�s recap here. If you are �thinking like a horse� then you will
    understand how a horse sees the world and when the environment changes, the
    horse may also change. That means YOU must change. When you are confident,
    well balanced and give the horse his head, so he see better and when you
    realize that at dusk or dawn a horse�s vision is decreased, then you can
    make adjustments to help the horse feel safer and more comfortable.
    Adjustments like understanding that a horse may be less secure, he may move
    his head more and he may stumble or trip more. If you are ready and
    expecting this behavior, then you can help the horse through these
    challenges. If you are clueless, want to blame the horse, and call him
    clumsy, stupid and not paying attention, then you show your lack of
    knowledge, understanding and your poor horsemanship.<br />
    <br />
    Understanding a horse is the best gift you can give to a horse. With
    understanding, you are able to help a horse feel more confident, grow with
    the horse and be a better partner for a horse.<br />
    <br />
    So, the next time you see a rider that is hurt from a horse accident, ask
    them what time the injury occurred. They may not understand why the time
    matters, but you will know.<br />

      <u><strong>Should Cows and Horses be kept together?</strong></u>
    </center>
    <u></u>
    <p></p>
    <p align="justify">
      So, I get a question about if it is alright to keep cows and horses
      together. Like most all horse questions, the answer is �It depends� -<br />
      <br />
      At first look, most would think, why not, cows and horses are both herd
      animals and they work together so it must be fine if they live together.
      Horses and cattle have shared pastures for many years. This was normal in
      the old days and in the time of the old west. However, things have changed
      so there are many new considerations. Superficially, keeping them together
      would seem correct, but like most things, when looked at a little deeper
      there are many other things to be considered.<br />
      <br />
      When dealing horses and making decisions about horses, I try to look at
      some various factors, a couple of these are what is best for the horse and
      what would I want if I were a horse. Like most of my articles, I try to
      put information out and give my opinion from my experiences and education,
      and then let the folks decide. I try not to give absolute yes or no
      answers to horse questions, since most time nothing fits every situation.
      Here is my short list of things that I think should be considered when
      making a decision to keep cattle and horses together.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Fencing:</u></strong
      ><u></u> Not a fan of barbed wire, it does lots of damage to horses since
      their hide is NOT has tough as cow hide. Most cattle fencing can be
      hazardous or damaging to horses. Cows tend to be harder on fencing, they
      lean, scratch and tend to push through a fence unless it is strong or
      creates pain or discomfort, like barbed, since that pokes them, or if it
      is electric, since it shocks them. I would rather electric fence over
      barbed wire. Gates that hold horses may NOT hold cattle. Many pastures
      with cattle will use cattle guards or cattle crossings to prevent cows
      from leaving out gates. A horse can break a leg on these so using them can
      create danger to a horse. (A cattle guard is a hole or trench at a gate
      and it is covered with rails or pipes so cars can drive over it, but
      cattle see the gaps and depth as danger and will not cross it.)<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Water:</u></strong
      ><u></u> Cows can be harder on a watering system. Their hooves go deeper
      in the mud and can break low buried piping or they can break automatic
      watering systems easier than horses. Special protections for water
      delivery systems need to be considered. More water and multiple sources
      are suggested. If you have a pond or creek, cattle like to stand, lay and
      be in the mud and water, this can keep the water dirty and muddy and pass
      on disease or parasites. In winter, if water is under cover, shelter or
      inside, cattle and horses will create a path or trench pretty quick. Since
      horses tend to be higher than cattle, in the herd hierarchy, they may keep
      cattle from accessing a single source of water. Which is why it is a good
      idea to have more than one water supply?<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Difference in Herd Behavior:</u></strong
      ><u></u> Horses and Cow are both herd animals. However, they are
      different. Horses have a stricter pecking order enforcement and tend to
      apply it more than cattle. I would say horses are more predatory when they
      are with other herd animals. Horses have an instinctive drive to be
      higher, to push lower animals and to dominate others. Cattle do not do
      this so much. Cattle are more submissive, lazy and not as curious or
      involved as horses, when it comes to position in the herd. This can be a
      problem or may be good.<br />
      <br />
      If you do not want your cattle moved, pushed or to lose weight then you
      would see this as a problem. If you like your horses to play and stay
      mentally stimulated and give your cattle some play and exercise, then this
      is not a problem. Horses tend to be higher than all cattle, expect maybe a
      bull. So cattle will move, avoid pressure and yield to horses. When horses
      figure this out - they like it. This makes a horse feel better and more
      dominate. Some horses may become more assertive, more pushier and sometime
      even be a little bully when it comes to the cows. Many think horses will
      get hurt by cows, I think cows are more likely to be hurt by horses, not
      necessarily intentional, but a horse will chase, bite, play or may kick at
      a cow and if they connect it could do damage. If cattle spook and run into
      a fence and a horse is in the way they can be hurt as well.<br />
      <br />
      The good thing is all herd animals feel safer and more secure in numbers,
      so both cattle and horses benefit from being together. More sets of eyes
      means a better chance of spotting danger or a predator. Cattle tend to
      spook more than horses and are not as social so they will move or stampede
      easier than horses. When together this can be a bad thing.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Shelter:</u></strong
      ><u></u> Again cows lean and push on things, if your shelters are not
      strong, I think cattle are more likely to damage or break shelters and or
      fences. Back to a previous point, if your shelters are enclosed, horses
      may claim it and may prevent cattle from using it. I like multiple
      shelters with multiple entry and exit points, good for both horses and
      cattle. Remember, cattle normally will not push past horses to get
      somewhere, so if your water or food is inside an enclosed area, horses may
      take over and not let cattle in since the cattle are lower. When horses do
      this, it is not because they are being mean it is because that is the way
      of the horse. This can be a problem in the heat of the or when it gets
      cold.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Insects or Parasites:</u></strong
      ><u></u> I think, in large numbers, cattle attract and have more flies
      than horses. Horses and cattle have different bugs, worms, parasites and
      diseases. This can create cross contamination and can increase the chance
      of passing things to each other. The one that comes to mind is hoof and
      mouth, this is a cow problem but horses can carry it without catching it.
      I find this more of a problem with large herds rather than with a few
      horses and a few cattle. Flies, ticks, mites and various worms will
      transfer to and from each other. Numbers will obviously increase all
      issues since it multiplies the risk.<br />

      <strong><u>Type of Cattle and Type of Horses:</u></strong
      ><u></u> I would not keep long horn cattle with horses, but have seen this
      done before. Some time there is no problems, others time a horse gets
      horned and has to be put down. I would NOT like horns around my horses.
      Calves can be another issue. Horses like to play and chase them; they may
      even claim them and keep them from their mom, so that is not a good
      situation. A breeding bull can be protective or aggressive. Horses that
      are used to work cattle can be hurt or benefit from this. It may
      desensitize some horses to cattle and remove their drive to chase; it may
      make other horses more aggressive. Aggressive cow horses can create a
      hostile or stressful environment for cattle. So how horses and cows
      interact can be influenced by their job, breeding or other factors.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Food and Feeding:</u></strong
      ><u></u> This can create <u>life-threatening issues</u>, so being aware of
      these dangers is critical to protecting your horses.
      <strong><i>DO NOT FEED HORSES CATTLE FEED.</i></strong
      ><i></i> This is a commonly over looked issue that can be deadly for a
      horse. Cattle can eat anything a horse can eat and will be fine. Cattle
      can also eat many things that will kill a horse or make them very sick.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Rumessin (aka: monensin)</strong> is very toxic to horses and it
      is commonly used in cow feed or cattle products. It is like a wormer and
      antibiotic to help keep cattle healthy. This supplement is also put in
      cattle blocks as well, so taking care to ensure you only have horse salt,
      mineral and other blocks in your pasture are important. With growing
      technology, humans have found ways to make cattle grow bigger, faster and
      stronger, the flip side is the things they feed cattle to get this result
      is toxic and can be deadly to horses. Back in the old days, cattle were
      fed oats, barley and corn with no additives so if horses shared it was
      never a concern. Good rules of thumb, if you have horses - do not feed or
      have any Rumessin or variations of it on site. I know people that keep
      cattle and horses separate and then cattle take down a fence and the horse
      go over, eat the cattle blocks, and die. Your horse, your responsibility
      to keep them safe.<br />
      <br />
      <strong><u>Pasture Care:</u></strong
      ><u></u> Personally, I do not care for cow poop. It creates large patties,
      attracts more flies and smells more. However, it is better fertilizer than
      horse poop, so that is good for the pasture. Cattle will go through more
      pasture than horses. Horses eat different than cattle so that can strain a
      pasture and since horses eat grass short, cattle cannot grab short grass.
      Horses tend to be more picky, if they have a choice and not starving, they
      will not normally eat moldy or bad food. If cattle are present, the cattle
      will eat the moldy food and will be fine, so that keeps your pastures
      cleaner and removes things that are not good for horses. Some people
      believe that horses should get first choice in pasture and then rotate
      cattle in afterwards to clean up.<br />
      <br />
      If you keep cattle and horses together, horse feed is normally better and
      more expensive than cow fee, so by feeding them together, cattle eat
      better but it cost more to feed them. Since horses are higher and dominate
      over cattle, horses will normally get first choice of food and what they
      leave, cattle will eat.<br />
      <br />
      Birds carry West Nile virus. Cattle tend to attract more birds that eat
      parasites off the cattle or pick through their poop. Although not a huge
      problem, it could increase the chances of mites, lice or other issues.<br />
      <br />
      Numbers are always a factor; too many cattle or too many horses can beat
      down and turn a pasture to dirt post haste. Cows do more damage to a field
      when they lay down, which horses do not do very much, and cattle may
      create bigger holes in mud where horses could get hurt. If cattle break
      down a fence, horses get free too.<br />
      <br />
      These are just some of things that need to be considered when putting
      cattle and horses together. With all that said, I will summarize my short
      answer. If I have small numbers of both, I would probably keep them
      together. No horns around my horses, multiple water sources, strong
      fencing and shelter, horse feed and grains only, no cattle feed and close
      monitoring and adjustments as needed.<br />
      <br />
      Hope that helps in giving you things to think about and consider before
      making an educated decision.<br />
      <br />
      Happy Trails,<br />

      Here is an article reprinted from FOX News, I have included the link if
      you click on the title above, but in case it is moved I have copied it
      below.<br />
      <br />
      Tracy McMillan, TV writer and author of "Why You're Not Married " one the
      most popular &nbsp;articles ever to appear on The Huffington Post
      &nbsp;responded this way to the backlash her piece elicited: "The truth
      will set you free. But first it will p**s you off."<br />
      <br />
      In the last two weeks my op-ed about why men are retreating from marriage,
      hit a nerve. In "The War on Men," which appeared here on FoxNews.com, I
      said women are angry. And they are. I was inundated with emails from women
      telling me I should be ashamed of myself for suggesting women have a role
      to play in the decline of marriage and battle of the sexes. One reader
      even told me to kill myself. No, really. Kill myself.<br />
      <br />
      My crime, apparently, is twofold. First I said men said women are no
      longer women. And in response, I suggested women get in touch with their
      feminine side. I didn't, however, say what I meant by that statement.
      That's because the article was supposed to be a teaser for my upcoming
      book, "How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage."<br />
      <br />
      Love today has become a power struggle, largely because women have been
      conditioned to keep their guard up - as though men and marriage will
      swallow them whole.<br />
      <br />
      But since the backlash has been so severe, with feminists convinced I want
      to set &nbsp;women back 200 years, I feel compelled to offer a sampling of
      what I meant by "surrendering" to one's femininity. As one woman named Lia
      asked, "What does it mean to surrender to our femininity in today's world?
      How do we reclaim our rightful gender roles without giving up our careers
      and independence?"<br />
      <br />
      It's easier than you think.<br />
      <br />
      You begin by accepting that men and women are different. Equal, but
      different. This means you'll have to reject feminist dogma since feminism
      has taught you that equality means sameness.<br />
      <br />
      Fortunately, there's been an explosion of brain research in the past
      several years to help explain male and female anatomy. The best books are
      Dr. Louann Brizendine's "The Male Brain" and "The Female Brain."<br />
      <br />
      Here's what we know: Females, in general, are nurturing and relational
      beings. They like to gather and nest and take care of people. They like to
      <strong>commiserate</strong> <i>(talk or gossip)</i> with other females ,
      a lot. That is why girls can talk for hours on end. It's why more women
      stay home with their children than men. It's why the teaching and care
      giving professions are still heavily female. Not every single woman in the
      world falls into this category, but that doesn't make the generalization
      any less true.<br />
      <br />
      Males, on the other hand, in general, are loners. They're content to mill
      about in their man caves. They like to hunt. They like to build things and
      kill things. If you don't have a son, this may sound strange. But again,
      that doesn't make it untrue, nor does the fact that not every single man
      in the world is like this. Men also take pride in caring for their
      families. They can't carry babies or nurse them, but they can provide for
      them. So let them.<br />
      <br />
      That, of course, is the gray area. Gone are the days of the breadwinning
      husband and the homemaking wife, right? So if I'm not referring to Ward
      and June Cleaver, what on earth do I mean? As Lia asked, what does it mean
      for "today's world"?<br />
      <br />
      It means women shouldn't let their success in the workplace become the
      biggest thing in their lives.<br />
      <br />
      If the ultimate goal is lasting love, women are going to have to become
      comfortable with sacrifice and capitulation. Because those are the
      underpinnings of a long-term marriage. for both sexes. If you don't
      believe me, ask your grandparents. Or anyone else who's been married for
      decades.<br />
      <br />
      Love today has become a power struggle, largely because women have been
      conditioned to keep their guard up, as though men and marriage will
      swallow them whole. As Sandra Bullock once said to Barbara Walters, "I'd
      always had this feeling that if you got married, it was like the end of
      who you were." That attitude is commonplace, and it's the direct result of
      a generation of feminists who told their daughters never to depend on a
      man.<br />
      <br />
      We live in a new world. But that doesn't mean it's a better world. Women
      are struggling more than ever with how to rectify their desire for
      independence with their desire for love. These two things can be
      reconciled. But you must first be open to ideas that sound blasphemous.<br />
      <br />
      Just because you make your own money doesn't mean your guy can't pay the
      bill. Just because you value independence doesn't mean you can't take your
      husband's last name. Just because you can do the same job a man can do
      doesn't mean you need to let him know it.<br />
      <br />
      Surrendering to your femininity means many things. It means letting your
      man be the man despite, the fact that you've proved you're his equal. It
      means recognizing the fact that you may very well want to stay home with
      your babies, and that that's normal. It means if you do work outside the
      home, you don't use your work to play tit-for-tat in your marriage. It
      means tapping into that part of yourself that's genuinely vulnerable and
      really does need a man, even though the culture says you don't.<br />
      <br />
      In other words, surrendering to your femininity means to put down your
      sword. It's okay if your guy's in charge. It's okay if you don't drive the
      car.<br />
      <br />
      In fact, it's rather liberating.<br />
      <br />
      Suzanne Venker has written extensively about politics, parenting, and the
      influence of feminism on American society. Her latest book, "How to Choose
      a Husband (And Make Peace with Marriage)" will be published in February
      2013.
