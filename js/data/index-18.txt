										<br>
										-- The Lone Ranger was ambushed and captured by an enemy Indian War Party. The Indian Chief proclaims, So, YOU are the great Lone Ranger. In honor of the Harvest Festival, YOU will be executed in three days. Before I kill you, I grant you three requests, what is your FIRST request?<br>
										<br>
										The Lone Ranger responds, I'd like to speak to my horse. The Chief nods and Silver is brought before the Lone Ranger who whispers in Silver's ear, and the horse gallops away. Later that evening, Silver returns with a beautiful blonde woman on his back. As the Indian Chief watches, the blonde enters the Lone Ranger's tent and spends the night. The next morning the Indian Chief admits he's impressed. You have a very fine and loyal horse, But, I will still kill you in two days. What is your SECOND request?</p>
										<p align="justify">The Lone Ranger again asks to speak to his horse. Silver is brought to him, and he again whispers in the horse's ear. As before, Silver takes off and disappears over the horizon. Later that evening, to the Chief's surprise, Silver again returns, this time with a voluptuous brunette, more attractive than the blonde. She enters the Lone Rangers tent and spends the night.</p>
										<p align="justify">The following morning the Indian Chief is again impressed. You are indeed a man of many talents, but I will still kill you tomorrow. What is your LAST request?</p>
										<p align="justify">The Lone Ranger responds, I'd like to speak to my horse, alone. The Chief is curious, but he agrees, and Silver is brought to the Lone Ranger's tent. Once they're alone, the Lone Ranger grabs Silver by both ears, Looks him square in the eye and says, Listen Very Carefully! FOR THE LAST TIME, I SAID "BRING POSSE"</p>

The rancher said, "okay, but don't go into that field over there...", as he pointed out the location. The DEA Agent verbally exploded and said, "look mister, I have the authority of the federal government with me!" Reaching into his rear back pocket, the arrogant officer removed his badge and proudly displayed it to the rancher. "See this badge?! This badge means I can go wherever I want... On any land! No questions asked, no answers given! Do you understand old man?!"<br>

										The rancher kindly nodded, apologized, and went about his chores. Moments later the rancher heard loud screams, he looked up and saw the DEA agent running for his life, being chased by the ranchers big Santa Gertrudis Bull...... With every step the bull was gaining ground on the officer, and it was likely that he'd sure enough get gored before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified. The old rancher threw down his tools, ran as fast as he could to the fence, and yelled at the top of his lungs.<br>

No questions asked or answered. Have I made myself clear? The old rancher nods politely and goes about his chores. Later, the old rancher hears loud screams and spies the Water Rep running for his life and close behind is the rancher's bull. The bull is gaining with every step.

										<p align="justify">An old prospector shuffled into the town of El Indio, Texas leading a tired old mule. The old man headed straight for the only saloon in town, to clear his parched throat. He walked up to the saloon and tied his old mule to the hitch rail.</p>
										<p align="justify">As he stood there, brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes, a young gunslinger stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other. The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, "Hey old man, can you dance?"</p>

The man asked for help. The farmer said Benny could pull his car out. So he backed Benny up and hitched Benny to the man's car bumper. Then he yelled, "Pull, Nellie, pull." Benny didn't move. Then he yelled, "Come on, pull Ranger." Still, Benny didn't move. Then he yelled really loud, "Now pull, Fred, pull hard." Benny just stood. Then the farmer nonchalantly said, "Okay, Benny, pull." Benny pulled the car out of the ditch. The man was very appreciative but curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times. The farmer said, "Oh, Benny is blind, and if he thought he was the only one pulling he wouldn't even try."</p>

										The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot. One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began nagging him again.<br>
										<br>
										Complain, nag, complain, nag--it just went on and on. All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet, caught her smack in the back of the head. The kick killed her dead on the spot.<br>

										At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement.<br>
										<br>
										This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it. So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men.<br>

										The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."<br>

										<p align="justify">The trainer is fuming and asks the jockey what went wrong. The jockey replies, "Nothing is wrong with me--it's this bloody horse. What is he--deaf or something?"</p>

										MAN: "What was that for?"<br>
										WIFE: "What was that piece of paper in your pants pocket with the name Marylou written on it?"<br>
										MAN: "Oh honey, remember two weeks ago when I went to the horse races? Marylou was the name of one of the horses I bet on." The wife looked all satisfied, apologizes, and goes off do work around the house. Three days later he is once again sitting in his chair reading and she repeats the frying pan swatting.<br>
										MAN: "What in the world was that for this time?"<br>
										WIFE: "Your horse called."</p>

"What kind of saddle do you want, English or Western?" "What's the difference?" asked the lady. "The western saddle has a horn on it," said the cowboy. "If the traffic is so thick here in the mountains that I need a horn on my saddle, I don't believe I want to ride."</p>

										<br>
										However, at the local auction, the going price of a horse was so high that he bought a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it he might as well goahead and enter it in the races, and to his surprise the donkey came in third. The next day, the racing sheets carried this headline:<br>
										<br>
										"PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS"<br>
										<br>
										The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that heentered it in the races again, and this time it won!<br>
										<br>

										The bishop was so upset with this publicitythat he ordered the preacher not to enter his donkey in another race.<br>
										<br>
										The headlines read: "BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS"<br>

										This was too much for the bishop and he ordered the preacher to get rid of the animal. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in the nearby convent.<br>
										<br>
										The headlines read: "NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN"<br>

										The bishop fainted! He informed the nun that shewould have to dispose of the donkey. She finally found a farmer willing to buy him for $10.<br>

										The paper read: "NUN PEDDLES ASS FOR TEN BUCKS"<br>

										<br>
										His buddy asks, 'How will I recognize him?<br>
										<br>
										'That's easy; he's a dwarf with a speech impediment.<br>
										<br>
										So, the dwarf shows up, and the guy asks him if he's looking for a male or female horse.<br>
										<br>
										'A female horth.<br>
										<br>
										So he shows him a prized filly.<br>
										<br>
										'Nith lookin horth. Can I thee her eyeth?<br>
										<br>
										So the guy picks up the dwarf and he gives the horse's eyes the once over.<br>
										<br>
										'Nith eyeth, can I thee her earzth?<br>
										<br>
										So he picks the little fella up again, and shows him the horse's ears.<br>
										<br>
										'Nith earzth, can I thee her mouf?<br>
										<br>
										The rancher is getting pretty ticked off by this point, but he picks him up again and shows him the horse's mouth.<br>
										<br>
										'Nice mouf, can I see her twat?<br>
										<br>
										Totally mad at this point, the rancher grabs him under his arms and rams the dwarf's head up the horse's fanny, pulls him out and slams him on the ground.<br>
										<br>
										The midget gets up, sputtering and coughing.<br>
										<br>
										'Perhapth I should rephrase that. Can I thee her wun awound a widdlebit?</p>
