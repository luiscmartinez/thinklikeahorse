												<p align="center">The Guy in the Glass<br>
												by Dale Wimbrow, 1934</p>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,<br>
													And the world makes you King for a day,<br>
													Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,<br>
													And see what that guy has to say.
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife,<br>
													Whose judgment upon you must pass.<br>
													The feller whose verdict counts most in your life<br>
													Is the guy staring back from the glass.
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													He's the feller to please, never mind all the rest,<br>
													For he's with you clear up to the end,<br>
													And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test<br>
													If the guy in the glass is your friend.
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													You may be like Jack Horner and "chisel" a plum,<br>
													And think you're a wonderful guy,<br>
													But the man in the glass says you're only a bum<br>
													If you can't look him straight in the eye.
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,<br>
													And get pats on the back as you pass,<br>
													But your final reward will be heartaches and tears<br>
													If you've cheated the guy in the glass.

											To understand the soul of a horse is the closest we humans can come to knowing perfection.<br>
											<br>
											There ain't a horse that can't be rode; there ain't a man that can't be thrown.<br>
											<br>
											God held a handful of ash, blew into it saying "Let it be the purest of creatures." Out of His hand galloped the horse.<br>
											<br>
											As his ungrateful rider whips and spurs, the horse thinks an important warning, "I can run faster without you!"<br>
											<br>
											On horseback you could ride through the cattle and they would pay no attention; but the minute you dismount, you become a threat.<br>
											<br>
											My horses are my friends, not my slaves.<br>
											<br>
											The horse, with beauty unsurpassed, strength immeasurable, and grace unlike any other, still remains humble enough to carry a man upon his back.<br>
											<br>
											Experienced riders are not prone to brag. And usually newcomers, if they start out being boastful, end up modest.<br>
											<br>
											The golden rule in dealing with a horse - is never to approach him angrily. Anger is so devoid of forethought that it will often drive a man to do things which in a calmer mood, he will regret.<br>
											<br>
											The size of a horse has nothing to do with the size of his heart.<br>
											<br>
											Small children are convinced that ponies deserve to see the inside of the house.<br>
											<br>
											Poverty is another word for owning a horse.<br>
											<br>
											For what the horse does under compulsion, is done without understanding; and there is no beauty in it, any more than if one would whip and spur a dancer.<br>
											<br>
											The knowledge of the nature of a horse is one of the first foundations of the art of riding it and every horseman must make it his principal study.<br>
											<br>
											In order to have good hands, they must be light, gentle, and firm.<br>
											<br>
											There are times when you can trust a horse, times when you can't and times when you have to.<br>
											<br>
											There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man.<br>
											<br>
											A little horseplay is the best way to enjoy a summer day!<br>
											<br>
											A horse is an angel without wings<br>
											<br>
											A good rider can hear his horse speak to him, a great rider can hear his horse whisper, but a bad rider won't hear his horse even if it screams at him!<br>
											<br>
											The hardest thing about learning to ride is the ground.<br>
											<br>
											The wagon rests in winter, the sleigh in summer, the horse never.<br>
											<br>
											A man of kindness to his horse, is kind, but brutal actions show a brutal mind.<br>
											<br>
											It is the difficult horses that have the most to give you.<br>
											<br>
											You cannot train a horse with shouts and expect it to obey a whisper.<br>
											<br>
											In training horses, one trains himself<br>
											<br>
											No hour of life is wasted that is spent in the saddle.<br>
											<br>
											A horse is an animal not a machine and is only as good as it's rider.<br>
											<br>
											It is a poor horseman that blames his horse for mistakes.<br>
											<br>
											Be wary of the horse with a sense of humor.<br>
											<br>
											Bread may feed my body, but my horse feeds my soul.<br>
											<br>
											Amazingly fast, incredibly strong, tirelessly proud, fantastically gentle, he is a huge dark beast that touches the hearts of all who meet him.<br>
											<br>
											The history of mankind is carried on the back of the horse.<br>
											<br>
											What the horse does under compulsion, is done without understanding and there is no beauty in it.<br>
											<br>
											Even the greenest horse has something to teach the wisest rider.<br>
											<br>
											Green on green equals black and blue.<br>
											<br>
											They say he rides like part of the horse, but they don't say which part.<br>
											<br>
											Give a horse what he needs and he will give you his heart in return.</p>

												<p align="justify">A horse in hand is worth a herd in the hills.<br>
												<br>
												Use your head, not your spurs.<br>
												<br>
												As a horse runs, think of it as a game of tag with the wind.<br>
												<br>
												To me, horses and freedom are synonymous.<br>
												<br>
												A horse can lend it's rider the speed and strength he or she lacks, but the rider who is wise remembers it is no more than a loan.<br>
												<br>
												A lovely horse is always an experience; It is an emotional experience of the kind that is spoiled by words.<br>
												<br>
												Many people have sighed for the "good old days" and regretted the "passing of the horse" but today, when only those who like horses own them, it is a far better time for horses.<br>
												<br>
												Horses change lives. They give our young people confidence and self-esteem. They provide peace and tranquility to troubled souls-they give us hope!<br>
												<br>
												May your belly never grumble, may your heart never ache; May your horse never stumble, may your cinch never break.<br>
												<br>
												Life is good; a horse makes it better.<br>
												<br>
												A horse already knows how to be a horse; the rider has to learn how to become a rider.<br>
												<br>
												A horse without a rider is still a horse; a rider without a horse is no longer a rider.<br>
												<br>
												You can tell a gelding, you can ask a mare, but you must discuss it with a stallion.<br>
												<br>
												Home away from home, is on a horse's back<br>
												<br>
												Horses are a lot like nuts and bolts - if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts<br>
												<br>
												A hot horse and a hot head don't mix.<br>
												<br>
												You know you love your horse when your mouth waters at the sight of a wagon-full of hay.</p>

												<p align="justify">Drop a heavy steel object on your foot, don't pick it up right away and Shout "Get off, Get off!"<br>
												<br>
												Leap out of a moving vehicle and practice rolling lightly into a ball and spring to your feet.<br>

												Learn to grab your checkbook and write out a $200 check without even looking down.<br>
												<br>
												Jog long distances carrying a halter and holding out a carrot.<br>
												<br>
												Practice dialing your chiropractor's number with both arms paralyzed to the shoulder and one foot anchoring the lead rope of a frisky horse.<br>
												<br>
												Borrow the US Army slogan; "Be all that you can be, add bitten, thrown, kicked, slimmed, trampled. Lie face down in the mud and repeat to yourself: "This is a learning experience"<br>
												<br>
												It is not enough that a man know how to ride; he must know how to fall</p>

													<h3>CONFUCIUS QUOTES</h3>
												</center>
												<p></p>
												<p align="justify"><u>Rotten wood cannot be sculpted.<br>
												<br>
												People who do not think far enough ahead, inevitably have worries near at hand.<br>
												<br>
												Be respectful at home, serious at work, faithful in human relations. Even if you go to uncivilized areas, their virtues are not to be abandoned.<br>
												<br>
												Exemplary People understand matters of justice; small people understand matters of profit.<br>
												<br>
												Exemplary people concern themselves with virtue, small people concern themselves with territory.<br>
												<br>
												Three kinds of friends are beneficial and three are harmful. When friends are honest sincere, or knowledgeable, they are beneficial. When friends are pretentious, fawning or opportunistic, they are harmful.<br>
												<br>
												Those whose paths are not the same do not consult one another.<br>
												<br>
												Those who are born knowing are best; those who know by leanings are next. Those who study only when they came to an impasse rank after that. Those who do not study even when at an impasse are considered lowest of the people.<br>
												<br>
												Those who have virtue have something to say, but those who have something to say do not necessarily have virtue.<br>
												<br>
												Good people decrease what is too much, to add to what is too little, accessing things and dealing impartially.<br>
												<br>
												Good people stop evil and promote good.<br>
												<br>
												Good people inspire others and nurture virtue.<br>
												<br>
												Cultivated people foster what is good in others, not what is bad. Petty people do the opposite.<br>
												<br>
												Study without thinking, and you are blind; think without studying, and you are in danger.<br>
												<br>
												Good people keep the petty at a distance, being stern without ill will.<br>
												<br>
												It is not good enough that everyone likes you or dislikes you. It is better when the good among the people like you and the bad dislike you.<br>
												<br>
												If you associate with those who are not centered in their actions, you will become either too uninhibited or too inhibited. Those who are too uninhibited are too aggressive, while those who are too inhabited are too passive.<br>
												<br>
												Good people refrain from what is improper.<br>
												<br>
												If you act on the basis of profit, you will be much resented.<br>
												<br>
												Cultivated people are ashamed to say more than they can do.<br>
												<br>
												Don�t worry about the recognition of others; worry about your own lack of ability.<br>
												<br>
												If you are personally upright, things get done without any orders being given. If you are not personally upright, no one will obey even if you do give orders.<br>
												<br>
												Confucius fished with a pole and did use a net; when he hunted, he did not shoot a roosting bird.<br>
												<br>
												Good people are careful about what they say and moderate in eating and drinking.<br>
												<br>
												To propitiate a spirit not one�s own is to curry favor; to see justice but not do it is to lack courage.<br>
												<br>
												Good people stand without changing places.<br>
												<br>
												The armed forces may be deprived of their commander, but a man cannot be deprived of his will.<br>
												<br>
												Good people are factual in their speech, consistent in their deeds.<br>
												<br>
												How do you please your boss, don�t deceive him, even if you have to offend him.<br>
												<br>
												Ideal people are universal and not clannish. Small minded people are clannish and not universal.<br>
												<br>
												I choose the good and follow it, and try to change what is not good.<br>
												<br>
												Good people forgive faults and pardon crimes.<br>
												<br>
												If you cannot correct yourself, what can you do about correcting others.<br>
												<br>
												To be poor without bitterness is easy; to be rich without arrogance is hard.<br>
												<br>
												People in power worry about getting something, once they have it they worry about losing it. As long as they are worried about losing, there is not telling what they will do.<br>
												<br>
												If you make a mistake and don�t correct it, that is called a mistake.<br>
												<br>
												Place loyalty and faithfulness first; don�t associate with anyone who is not as good as you are, and don�t hesitate to change when you have erred.<br>
												<br>
												Virtue is never isolated; it always has neighbors.<br>
												<br>
												It those nearby are pleased, those far away will come.<br>
												<br>
												Good people prepare weapons to guard against the unexpected.<br>
												<br>
												To go to war with untrained people is tantamount to abandoning them.<br>
												<br>
												Few lose out on account of Prudence.<br>
												<br>
												Good people follow virtue, building on the small to attain the great.<br>
												<br>
												There are sprouts that do not send up shoots; there are shoots that do not bear fruit.<br>
												<br>
												Don�t wish for speed; don�t see small advantages. If you wish for speed, you won�t succeed; If you see small advantages, great things will not be accomplished.<br>
												<br>
												Cultivated people reach upward; petty people reach downward.<br>
												<br>
												Superior people can certainly come to an impasse. It is the petty person who loses self-control at an impasse.<br>
												<br>
												Good people persist to the end and find out if something is wrong.<br>
												<br>
												Promote the honest over the crooked, and the people will obey. Promote the crooked over the honest and the will surly not obey.<br>
												<br>
												Respond to hostility with honesty; respond to virtue with virtue.<br>
												<br>
												Good people articulate directions and carry out tasks.<br>
												<br>
												In funerals, sadness is more important than the arrangements.<br>
												<br>
												When Confucius ate beside someone in mourning, he never ate his fill. On a day that he had himself mourned, Confucius did not sing.<br>
												<br>
												Good people consider problems and prevent them.<br>
												<br>
												A cultivated person does not promote people on account of what they say, nor ignore what is said because of who is saying it.<br>
												<br>
												When everyone dislikes something, it should be examined. When everyone likes something, it should be examined.<br>
												<br>
												A commitment to better oneself therefore implies dedication to the welfare of others.<br>
												<br>
												Crimes among the lower classes reflects corruption in the upper classes.<br>

													<u>This old horse, the Rancher said,<br>
													she�s seen some better days,<br>
													she�s eating up my profits,<br>
													and costs a lot for hay.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me,<br>
													a stronger one at that,<br>
													shes seen a lot of miles<br>
													just like my cowboy hat.<br>
													<br>
													This old horse, the Rancher said,<br>
													she helped me herd my steer,<br>
													I�m pretty sure shes magic,<br>
													I know I hold her dear.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me,<br>
													one that can run fast,<br>
													maybe one that�s younger,<br>
													or maybe one that lasts.<br>
													<br>
													This old horse, the Rancher said,<br>
													she�s long and far in tooth,<br>
													my children do remember,<br>
													her fondly from their youth.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me,<br>
													a gelding in his prime,<br>
													one that needs less fixin�,<br>
													that helps me save a dime.<br>
													<br>
													Why, they asked, then keep her?<br>
													why not trade her now?<br>
													bring her to an auction?<br>
													replace her with a cow?<br>
													<br>
													The Rancher's brow grew heavy,<br>
													he took a staggered step,<br>
													his eyes did show his hardships,<br>
													in wrinkles, as they crept.<br>
													<br>
													His breath, he took in deeply,<br>
													as he poised to say his words,<br>
													it�s as if the earth grew silent,<br>
													that his message should be heard.<br>
													<br>
													This old horse, the Rancher said,<br>
													has given me her life,<br>
													I wouldn�t trade for anything,<br>
													nor either, would my wife.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me,<br>
													and perhaps someday will come,<br>
													but this old gal, I love her,<br>
													she is the chosen one.<br>
													<br>
													This old horse, the Rancher said,<br>
													her service she did lend,<br>
													her and I, have seen the years,<br>
													this old horse, she is my friend.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me well,<br>
													but her home is here to keep,<br>
													I owe her sanctuary,<br>
													my love for her is deep.<br>
													<br>
													Another horse would suit me well,<br>
													and younger days for me,<br>
													and I will keep my promise,<br>
													until our last breaths, set us free."</u>
