													<p>Signs of a Healthy Horse</p>
													<div>
														<p align="justify"><em>Appetite</em> - If there is no logical explanation for loss of appetite, regard it as one of the first signs of illness.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Coat and skin</em> - Coat will vary with breed, season and housing conditions (stabled and/or rugged). For instance, the thoroughbred has a fine coat in summer; the Shetland has a long, thick, two layered coat in winter. When the coat is long or thick, short or fine, it should be evenly distributed, except during the process of shedding the winter coat in spring. Normally the coat should be soft with luster. The skin should be supple and elastic with no sign of bald patches, rubbing, inflammation or oozing.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Condition and weight</em> - A horse's condition varies with breeds, feed and exercise. Some may be well muscled and others may be fat or thin. A thin horse is not necessarily unhealthy. A horse on the same ration and exercise routine maintains a certain weight for years. If suddenly, or over a period of time, it starts to loose weight, check your horse carefully. Weight loss or gain in association with some other signs, e.g. poor coat, diarrhea, poor appetite, lethargy or poor work performance, is indicative of a health problem.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Conformation</em> - To examine a horses conformation, look at it standing still from a short distance away to ascertain overall balance, then examine it more closely for overall body detail, limb detail and relationship of limbs to each other. The horse should then be observed in motion to evaluate its conformation. Limping or unevenness could indicate a problem.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Demeanor</em> - This may vary tremendously in different breeds, individuals and situations. Changes in demeanor such as quiet or excited, alert to dull, placid to aggressive, relaxed to restless, may indicate a more significant problem.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Droppings</em> - This usually occurs 10 - 15 times a day. Color, consistency, volume, odor and frequency of droppings vary considerably with type of feed and exercise. A horse on a well balanced diet should pass droppings that are brown, formed, tend to break up as they hit the ground and have an odor that is not unpleasant. Horses on lush green feed will often pass greenish, unformed, cow like droppings. Those on large volumes of low grade hay will pass hard, dark colored pellets.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>Ears</em> - These should stand erect in an alert but not rigid position. One ear should not flop nor should there be any sign of discharge or heavy wax build up.</p>
														<p align="justify"><em>**The only thing predictable about a horse is that it's unpredictable.**</em></p><br>

														<p><strong><u>Horse Ear Massage Map</u></strong></p>
														<p align="justify">Here is a picture of an horse ear and it has been labeled to map out different parts of the horse, much like the foot has been mapped out for massages to different parts of the human body. Not sure if this works or is accurate, but it appears interesting and I know horses likes to have their ears massaged, once they have been properly desensitized. If you click on the picture it will open a PDF on <a href="images/equinemassage.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><u>Equine Massage.</u></strong><u></u></a><br>
														<br>
														<u>I am not promoting this for healing or endorsing the concept that rubbing a horse's ear heals or fixes problems.</u> I am not into tricks or gimmicks. However since rubbing a horse's ear does <u>not</u> do any damage, I see no harm in this and it does some benefit, since it helps sack out the ears and promotes bonding and trust between horse and human. Like always use common sense. I have gotten a few emails lecturing me, that since I have this on my site, I am being fooled or mislead and this is crap. So let's be clear people, <strong>I am not endorsing or selling this.</strong> I simply am putting it out here since I see no harm, unless some idiot decides to use only this - thinking it will solve all their problems. In that case, if you believe that then I can't help you and you would probably not be on my site.</p>

															<p align="justify">Horses have eyes on the side of their head, like most prey animals (Deer, sheep, etc). This is so they can see greater area around them to identify predators. Predators, like humans, dogs and wolves have eyes in front of their head so they can focus and catch prey animals. Eyes in front give better depth perception but less peripheral vision. Horses will often move their head up and down to try to focus on things. This is why collecting and holding a horses head tucked will often cause a horse to stumble or fall.</p>

															<p align="justify">Most foals are born at night under the cover of darkness and away from preying eyes and possible danger. Mares will clean the foal and relocate quickly to move away from the afterbirth, which may attract predators.

														<h3><!-- ParagraphTitleStart -->
														 <u>WAYS TO TELL A PERSON UNDERSTANDS A HORSE:</u> <!-- ParagraphTitleEnd --></h3>
														<div>
															<p align="justify">Watch a person handle, lead, work and ride a horse. You can tell if they really know and understand a horse.</p>
															<p align="justify"><u>How they Handle a horse</u>:</p>
															<p align="justify">Good: If they handle the horse calmly, smoothly and with confidence. Does the horse respond to their request with ease and respect. Do they communicate clearly with cues and body language on what they want. Are they consistent. Do they move the horse when the horse test them or acts disrespectful. Are horse's calm with them or nervous, upset and uneasy.</p>
															<p align="justify">Bad: If they fight, argue and force the horse to do everything. If they talk to the horse like they talk to their kid. Does the horse react to their demands with fear. Do they chastise the horse verbally like he understand what they are saying. Do they blame the horse for everything bad it does wrong. When they correct the horse do they have to talk about and explain and make a big deal about it. By drawing attention they think they are showing how good they are? Do they use stud chains, tie downs, big bits, draw reins, bungee cords, or twitches? Do they tie bags in the stall or put other scary things in the stall thinking they are sacking out?</p>
															<p align="justify"><u>Leading a horse</u>:</p>
															<p align="justify">This is a dead give away. I can watch a person lead a horse and know with 95% accuracy that the person either has horse sense or has no clue.</p>
															<p align="justify">Good: The horse follows the person on a SLACK rope. The person communicates with body language and encourages the horse to follow on a SLACK rope. The horse follows calmly with his head down like he is comfortable and knows what to do. The horse stops when the person stops and walks when the person walks. You will not hear or see how the horse knows to stop or start. They will not be raising their voice, yanking the head, have a tight rope, talking or dragging the horse. It is smooth and easy. Other people will comment that the horse is good and calm. They don't get it, the person causes a horse to be the way it is. If they got it, they would know the person knows what they doing and that is why the horse is good. However if they admit this, then they would have to admit that their horse is bad because of them and then they could not blame the horse for being bad! They will not be yelling raising their voice and making a big deal out of everything. Quiet mouth and quiet hands!</p>
															<p align="justify">Bad: The person holds the horse by the snap or right under the chin! Dead give away. The person is not confident, thinks they can control the horse if their hand is close to halter. The horse is pulled when you want it to walk. The horse is pulled or yelled at when you want it to stop. The horse looks around and is not comfortable. The horse pulls towards food or other areas and tries to drag person. The person ignores the horse and does other things like talk, answer the phone and then blames the horse for pulling and not standing still. The person will be constantly correcting the horse, changing directions trying to pull the horse and be angry and upset or always in a hurry and complaining about how bad, stubborn and hardheaded their horse is.</p>
															<p align="justify"><u>Riding a horse</u>:</p>
															<p align="justify">This will tell a lot about the confidence and riding ability of the rider.</p>
															<p align="justify">Good: The person prepares the horse to mount. The person mounts by jumping up into the saddle smoothly, puts their leg over softly and sits softly in the saddle. The horse does not walk off or try to leave during mounting or after being mounted. The reins are not pulled, yanked or tight. The rider sits in balance has the horse stands calmly before riding off. The horse walks off without the rider appearing to do anything. NO KICKING the horse to make it go. The reins are kept loose and the horse moves like he knows what the rider wants. The rider's hands are slow, smooth and do not move much. You will notice the reins are always slack or released when the horse gives a correct response. The less movement you see from the rider the better they are.</p>
															<p align="justify">Bad: The person fights with the horse before mounting. The rider tugs and yanks on the horse to try and make it stand still to mount. The person hops with their foot in the stirrup trying to get the horse to stop moving. The person pulls the saddle to them as they slowly struggle to get up into the saddle, pulling the horse and saddle off balance. While getting on they are unaware how they are pulling on the reins and the reins are tight and pulling to stop the horse from moving. The rider appears off balance and leans back and forth trying to get their foot into the stirrups. The horse walks off and the rider yells at it and yanks on the reins and blames the horse for not listening or standing still. Then the horse walks off and the rider lets it and laughs and makes a joke that the horse is ready to go. The reins are held in one hand and tight and the horse's head is pulled or yanked in the direction the rider wants him to go. You will not see any release from the rider when the horse gives a correct response. As you are watching you will not even know what the rider wants from the horse and the two will not be working as a team, they will be both wanting different things, trying and doing different things. The rider will constantly move their hands and use the reins for balance. The horse will ignore the reins from all the movement that means nothing. The horse or rider will not be relaxed.</p>
															<p align="justify"><u>Round Pen Work or Lunging:</u></p>
															<p align="justify">Good: The person will have a horse respond calmly. The horse will appear to know what the person is asking and will do what is asked. The horse will not appear scared and fearful. The horse will move in a direction told at the speed requested. The horse will stop and come when asked. There will not be a whip used or popped to scare the horse. The person will use multiple cues, voice, body, movement, and others to ensure the horse knows the right answer and what to do. The person will not chase the horse to make it run. They will not make fast running movements which threaten the horse. They will get the horse to do inside and outside turns in the round pen. The person will immediately stop pressure when the horse moves. They will not continue to chase or spin a rope after the horse moves. If the horse tries to put pressure, the person will respond appropriately with just enough pressure to overcome the horse's pressure and get the desired response. The horse will move not run fearful. The horse will come to person when told to and will lock (hook on) on to person and follow person while off line.</p>
															<p align="justify">Bad: The person will be loud, fast and jumpy. They will chase the horse, they will run after the horse after the horse is moving. They will not stop pressure after the horse gives the a correct answer. The horse will appear to be fearful and running and reacting not responding. The horse will appear to be looking for the right answer and will not look confident or will not know what the right answer is. The horse will not move correctly and will try and run past the person and will not turn with asked but will race to get past person faster. The person will blame the horse for not know how to lunge and not being a smart horse. They will say this horse is bad, stubborn and untrained. They will get mad at the horse and use a whip to make it run faster and cut the horse off with a whip to make the horse turn. After all it has to be the horse's fault, it can't be the person's fault.</p>
															<p align="justify"><u>Conclusion</u>:</p>
															<p align="justify">A good horseman knows it is never the horse's fault. They will never blame the horse. A horse only reacts to the people around them. There are no bad horses, only bad and uneducated people that cause a horse to do bad things. If a horse is good, he is being handled by a good person who understand horses. (Unless the horse is being bullied or controlled by pain) A horse is good when he feels safe, secure and is treated fairly. By fairly, I mean he knows what to expect, he does not get ambushed or surprised, he is NOT always guessing what will happen next, he knows, because he gets good clear and consistent cues, he is prepared for a move (not ambushed) and he gets release of pressure when he gives the right answer. If a horse gives the wrong answer, you asked the questions wrong. If a horse fails, the person caused him to fail. If a horse blows up, the person pushed him too far, too fast. If a horse acts bad, he was not given the right direction to find the right answer. When a horse is good, the person is giving good guidance, when he is bad, the person is confusing or scaring him to react and not respond. A horse is only a reflection of the person handling him. Where you see good horses, you will find good horsemen. A horse is not good if he is being controlled by big bits, spurs, pain or fear. Only when you accept that you cause all actions from the horse, will you be able to learn, grow and critically evaluate yourself as to what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong. Remember, it is never the horse's fault.</p>

															<p><strong><u><br>
															Bog Spavin:</u></strong> Soft spongy Bursal enlargement of the hock joint capsule. Located towards the front inside of the hock joint.</p>
															<p>ossible Causes: bang or blow to the joint, wear and tear from work on hard surfaces. Poor confirmation and possible vitamin/mineral imbalance while horse is young.</p>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Bowed Tendons:</u></strong> Inflammation and in severe cases even rupture of the sheath encasing the tendon from the knee to the fetlock. One or both the deep flexor tendon and superficial flexor tendons on one and/or both front legs may be affected.</p>Possible Causes: severe trauma and over extension of the one of more of the tendons. Insufficient conditioning, fatigue and possibly blow to the leg.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Capped Hocks:</u></strong> Bursal Enlargement - up to the size of a tennis ball on the point of the hock.<br></p>Possible Causes: a blow or bang to the point of the hock - usually from horse kicking a wall or from lying down on a hard concrete surface.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Capped Knees:</u></strong> Acute inflammation (bursal enlargement) or bruise of knee joint (carpitis) and/or the tendon that runs over the front of the knee.<br></p>Possible Causes: Blows to the knee joint from a fall or from animal banging its knees on a feed manger.

Open knees wounds could need veterinary attention.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Curbs:</u></strong> Inflammation on the upper rear of the cannon area just below the point of the hock<br></p>Possible Causes: Bang or blow the back of the leg - possibly from kicking the wall. Stress and trauma from a violent extension of the Plantar Ligament.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Jack Spavin:</u></strong> A bony growth that can irritate tendon that lies over the inside hock. Can be very painful when the hock is flexed or bent.<br></p>Possible Causes: a bang or blow to the joint. Stress or trauma or poor conformation.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Knee Spavin:</u></strong> Bony growth at back of knee on inner side. Not very common.<br></p>Possible Causes: Joint stress, trauma from a blow.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Osselets Green:</u></strong> Inflammation of the joint capsule in the front of the fetlock joint is referred to as "green" osselets.<br></p>Possible Causes: Excessive racing of young horses while joints are still developing.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Osselets True:</u></strong> Bony growth at the front of the fetlock joint.<br></p>Possible Causes: A late stage development of "green osselets" that were not allowed to heal.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Sesamoiditis:</u></strong> Inflammation of the bone above and at the back of the fetlock joint.<br></p>Possible Causes: Blow, Bang or trauma to the back of the fetlock joint.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Shin Splints or Bucked Shins:</u></strong> Inflammation of the membrane that covers the Shin bone (cannon bone).<br></p>Possible Causes: Concussion - especially in young horses.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Speedy Cut:</u></strong> Injury do to striking the inner and lower side of the knee with the inside toe of the opposite hoof.</p>Possible Causes: poor conformation, occasional erratic movement of limbs during turnout or exercise.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Splints:</u></strong> Bony enlargements (sometimes up to the size of a half golf ball) usually on the inside of the front legs just below the knee. Sometimes multiple smaller bumps running down between the Splint and Cannon bones. Most often on forelegs but can occur on hind legs.<br></p>Possible Causes: poor conformation, rapid growth, trauma or striking the leg with the other hoof.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Sprained Ankle:</u></strong> Affecting one or more of the ligaments the support the fetlock joint.<br></p>Possible Causes: stress to the ligaments of the joint from over extension.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Sprained Suspensory Ligament:</u></strong> Inflammation and strain of the suspensory ligament the runs down from the knee and wraps around the fetlock joint.<br></p>Possible Causes: stress and trauma to the ligament from over extension and fatigue.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Stocking Up:</u></strong> Fluid retention in the lower limbs.<br></p>Possible Causes: poor circulation due to lack of exercise and overfeeding of grain. Some horse's legs will fill if confined to a stall or trailer after strenuous exercise. May or may not indicate initial kidney problems. Some horses are predisposed to stock up.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Thoroughpin</u></strong> Bursal enlargement of the deep digital flexor tendon sheath in hollow area between the back of the hock joint and the point of the hock.</p>Possible Causes: stress to the tendon from over exertion, over extension and trauma to the tendons and joint. Poor conformation of the hock joint.<br>
															<p><strong><u><br>
															Wind Puffs or Wind Galls:</u></strong> Soft "spongy" swellings around the back, front and or side of the fetlock joint. The inflamed joint capsule distends with additional synovial fluid in an effort to protect against injury.<br></p>Possible Causes: A joint concussion, excessive work while horse is young &amp; joints are still developing, stress &amp; fatigue due to intense work load on the joints.

																	<strong><u>Discussion on Helmets and Horse Riding</u></strong><u></u>
																</center>
																<p></p>
																									<p align="justify">Here is my response to this report:</p>
																<p align="justify"></p>
																<center>
																	<img border="0" height="400" src="images/over safety.jpg" width="400">
																</center>
																<p></p>
																<p align="justify">I am a horseman, not to be confused with a horse owner, horse rider or horse showman. I did an article in direct conflict with your stats. I push for better education and smarter decisions and I think a helmet is a false sense of security. Your stats are compelling and make my point. The fact that only 10% of injuries were work related demonstrates that people who need and work with a horse for a living are less likely to be injured since they are more likely experienced horsemen.</p>
																<p align="justify">However, in the horse world nowadays, where 90% of all horse owners are women and 80% of all horse owners get out of horses in the first year (normally from fear or injury), shows a huge turn over which results in many inexperienced horse owners. The majority of horses now are kept in Boarder Barns where experience is low and with the high turn-over of horses and owners, the same bad lessons are being taught and repeated. It would be interesting to know how many hurt people owned horses and for how long, were they rented horses, borrowed horses or leased, all of this would show, in my opinion that experience, confidence and expertise was a big factor in the injuries. I wonder how many or what percentage of injuries were from working horsemen that worked, lived and owned their own horses for many years? I work with so called dangerous horses and work in herds of horse where the odds of getting kicked or hurt is tremendously multiplied, yet I have not been hurt in these higher risk scenarios. I do not wear a helmet and when I have tried, it did some negative things that for me, made it more dangerous such as, impeding my vision, interfering with my hearing, throwing off my balance from adjusting and moving the helmet as I tried to ride and all of this distracts me from the much needed attention that should be devoted to watching my horse, observing my surroundings, predicting danger or communicating with my horse with full attention. Also knowing I am not wearing a helmet keeps more focused that my risk of injury is greater if I slack off my horsemanship skills.</p>
																<p align="justify">My web site (www.thinklikeahorse.org) is very informative and I try and educate people to understand a horse better so they are safer with knowledge and understanding rather than just putting on a helmet. I think education and understanding of a horse will keep you safer in the long term than just wearing a helmet. I know the argument is if it may help why not use it, I think it hurts more than it may helps in many cases.</p>
																<p align="justify">As a retired cop and retired military, there is a behavior called the 'Superman Syndrome (SMS)'. It results when people are so protected that they feel safer and are more willing to take greater risk since they think they are more protected and less likely to get hurt, even if something goes bad. This happens when race car drivers get 5 point seat belts and helmets and fire proof suits, it also happens when SWAT teams get better full bullet proof protection suits so they don't use tactics and rely on their bullet proof attire and in the military, people will take unnecessary risk since when they know they have better equipment and lots of back up with aircraft and artillery support as opposed to being on their own with little back up. I think this happens in the horse world with the "magical" helmet protection theory.</p>
																<p>Here is a study that was done in Australia:<br>

																<p align="justify">I see people riding and working with horses all the time and they do not know what they are doing or how much in danger they are. I see people get on horses that I know should not be ridden and are going to buck or run off and yet lots of people, mainly women with helmets, do things they should not, but they get this false since of security from the helmet or fall into the SMS and do things they should not. And of greater interest to me, the horse pays every time a person gets hurt. So, from my view, a helmet not only gets people in trouble, it hurts horses as well.</p>

																	<h3><strong><u>Why does a Horse Yawn:</u></strong> <u></u></h3>
																	<p></p>
																	<p align="justify">My own personal theory and answer on this is the same answer for most all horse questions, "It Depends."</p>
																	<p align="justify">Let's talk about what a yawn is. A yawn is a reflexive and involuntary action. It causes the jaw to drop, the mouth to open, an inhalation of air, filling of the lungs, increasing air intake, the abdominal muscles flex, the diaphragm is pushed down, the jaw is stretched, opening the tubes of the ear canal and eardrums and equalizing pressure in the inner ear. Then it is followed by exhalation of air in a calming release of energy and relaxed type action. <i><strong>The average yawn last a bout six seconds.</strong></i><strong></strong> Yawning is said to be involuntary since humans yawn before they are born. A person's heart rate can rise up to 30 percent during a yawn. The elevated heart rate could be caused by a stimulation of the Vagus nerve. There is some evidence that suggest when yawning, the extended jaw stimulates the Vagus Nerve, which controls the heart and is located in the neck, and this stimulation contributes to the elevated heart rate. Many think a yawn is associated with boredom or a lack of interest. Other evidence suggests it occurs when a person is faced with worrying or a dangerous situation. Folklore states you should cover your mouth when yawning to prevent the soul from escaping. There is also a Brain cooling theory. Since Cool Brains can think more clearly, a sudden increase of oxygen can cool the brain, therefore preparing for clearer thinking or better decisions.</p>
																	<p align="justify">Some causes or reasons for yawns vary. Some say it is from tiredness, lack of sleep, boredom, mimicking behavior, warning, threat, health benefit or to increase alertness. <i><strong>As humans most can relate to yawning when bored, tired or yawning when we see others yawn.</strong></i><strong></strong> Other animals prey and predator will yawn for different reasons. There is some evidence that some yawning can be medically related, like in diabetes, medicine side affects, and stroke or chemical/adrenaline release. Another medical belief is that when the body lacks oxygen, a yawn is a way to increase the oxygen content of the blood and a way to get blood rich oxygen to the brain. This oxygen can also cause alertness and help to keep you awake or it could be to make you more alert. The side affects of this and what could be another cause, is the body may sense too much carbon dioxide in the blood and by getting a big breath with a big exhale; you increase oxygen and decrease carbon dioxide. Could a human yawn be a survival instinct that was previously used for preparing for battle or a fight, could it be instinctual, could it be the body's way of giving an oxygen boost before a confrontation to assist in strength or speed? In police work and in the military, people yawn before and after high stress situations. Paratroopers yawn before jumping out of a plane, SWAT members yawn before a hostile entry, cops yawn after they are shot at or after they shoot at someone, all related to stress, lack of oxygen or need for oxygen, using too much oxygen, increased heart rate and other reasons. <i><strong>You can read more about the affects of fear and the body's response on my <a href="horse_fear.html" target="_blank"><strong><u>Horse and Rider Fear page (Click here).</u></strong></a></strong></i></p>
																	<div class="indented">
																		<p align="justify">Next time you go to the gym look around, you will see people yawning. This could show a lack of fitness, a lack of oxygen, an expression of tiredness or a way to get a boost of oxygen before a big lift or strain. Since yawning is contagious, it can be caused by seeing a yawn, talking about a yawn or suggesting a yawn. <i><strong>The odds are that before you finish reading this article, you will yawn at least once. Did you do it yet?</strong></i><strong></strong></p>
																	</div>
																	<p></p>
																	<hr>
																	<p></p>
																	<p align="justify"></p>
																	<center>
																		<strong>Side Fact: All vertebrates (including fish) yawn, but only humans, chimps and dogs find yawns contagious.</strong>
																	</center>
																	<p></p>
																	<p></p>
																	<hr>
																	<p></p>
																	<p align="justify">Let's talk about some things that most people do NOT associate yawns with. Some animals will sometime yawn to show off their large teeth or big mouth, a show of strength or to threaten or intimidate others. Some say a yawn can be a warning to other herd members to get prepared for flight or fight or to wake up the herd and to make them more alert. When an animal is nervous they sometime will yawn and this could be from stress and this stress could be emotional and or physical. Nervousness can be caused by fear or threat of fear. Some Primates and Feline species see a yawn as a form of challenge or disrespect. Others species may yawn as a way to show submission or respect. When a foal or young horse meets an older horse they clack their teeth, this is accompanied with an out stretched neck, open jaw and mouth, much like a yawn. Dogs will open their jaws when dominating lower dogs. After a dog pins a lower dog and gets on top of the lower dog, the dog on top will open his jaw wide, like a yawn and show his strength and to show off his large canine teeth. Some yawns may be a way of deception to make the enemy appear safe and relaxed before a surprise attack. Some Penguins use yawning as a way to court the opposite sex. Dogs will sometime yawn after humans yawn. I have seen dogs yawn when they are confused or trying to figure something out. Snakes yawn or do a yawning type motion when trying to align their jaw after swallowing a large meal. Some animals yawn when in pain or discomfort. <i><strong>So as you can see the causes of a yawn are varied.</strong></i><strong></strong></p>
																	<p align="justify">Most agree that yawning normally increases your state of alertness and awareness. Many humans can understand this if they have every driven when extremely tired. I remember yawning almost uncontrollably five or ten time in few minutes in an attempt not to fall asleep while driving long distances. I now look back and see that the yawning could have been a way for the body to warn me of danger. The danger was if I fall asleep while driving on a highway at 60 mph I could kill me or someone else.</p>
																	<p align="justify">An important thing to remember is to notice and be aware of what is going on when your horse yawns. That is key to better understand of why your horse is yawning at a particular time. No right or wrong answer and no one will know for sure. However, I am sure there are lots of barn managers and life long horse owners that will have the absolute one answer for every horse problem and will be willing to share it with you. That should be a big clue that they do NOT know what they are talking about.</p>
																	<div class="indented">
																		NOTE: This is important to know and remember: It is OK to say I don't know or I am not sure when it comes to horses. Knowing and accepting that there are so many variables and unknowns in horses, anyone that claims to know it all, only proves they don't know much at all. <i><strong>Good Horsemen do not ever think they know it all and will always be willing to listen to their horse and learn more from the horse.</strong></i> <strong></strong>
																		<p></p>

																	<p align="justify"></p>
																	<center>
																		<i><strong>There is none so blind then those who do not want to see.</strong></i>
																	</center><i><strong></strong></i><strong></strong>
																	<p></p>
																	<p align="justify">In closing this simple and non-complex topic about horses and the reasons they MAY yawn. Horses yawning could be a way that a horse clears dust from their airway; it could be a sign of abdominal pain or colic; it could be to relieve the pain from ulcers; to dislodge something from the cheek and gum; it could be to release endorphins for calming; it could be a sign of submission; a sign to warn or alert the herd; lack of oxygen; release of stress; showing of teeth; a threat or warning; a show of tiredness; a realigning of the jaw after a metal pain bit is removed; possible oral or jaw pain; some horses yawn when morning the loss of their close friend or companion and a horse could yawn for many other reasons.</p>
																	<div class="indented">
																		<p align="justify">I am sure that many have heard when a horse chews or licks his lips he is learning or just has learned something. I debunk this and give a more reasonable alternative answer to this on my site. I think the same argument can be made about yawning. It could also be associated with learning, release of pressure or relaxing.</p>
																	</div>
																	<p align="justify">I think the best indicate on why a horse has yawned is paying attention to what just happened or what is happening in the horse's environment. I think it is best, like most things with horses, <i><strong>when a horse yawns you should examine the circumstances or situation the horse is in or has just come from.</strong></i> <strong></strong> Things to consider could be new training, fear, pressure, excitement, boredom, herd dynamics, release of pressure and other things.</p>
																	<p align="justify">By being <u>the smarter dumb animal</u> and by looking deeper and seeing the world through the horse's eyes, we are more likely to figure out why a horse yawns in each specific situation. <i><strong>Always looking at things from a horse's point of view will help you understand more about the horse.</strong></i> <strong></strong> Like all things in horses, if you look for the easy or fast answer, you hinder advancement for yourself and your horse. Like most horse questions, there are no easy or short answers, it depends on many other factors, known and unknown. So the next time you see someone yawn or see another animal yawn, stop and think about what is going on, why it may be happening and what might have been the possible causes.</p>
																	<p align="justify">So this article started out from a question from someone that wanted me to tell them why their horse yawned. And like most things I cover, I only scratched the surface of this complex and ever expanding topic. I have hopefully demonstrated once again, that there are no easy or short answers in horsemanship and no one will ever know it all, but that should not stop anyone from continuing to try and learn as much as they can about our faithful loving companions, Our Horse.</p>

And someone will say it is not the bit it the hands. The Hands put the bit on and the tie down on. So trying to justify this by saying it is the hands is BS.

																	<p align="justify"><strong><u>Introducing Horses to New Homes or places:</u></strong> <u></u><br>
																	<br>
																	Getting or moving horses to new areas can be stressful for horses. If you understand a horse and know how they think, you can better prepare both horse and arrival so it is less stressful for the horse.<br>
																	<br>
																	Plan not to arrive at new places at night. Even thou a horse can see well at night, it increases the chance of accident and the horse will take longer to relax or settle in. Plus you want other horses to be able to see each other to lessen the change of an accidental kick or bite, since pecking order, hierarchy and herd dynamics will be an issue.<br>
																	<br>
																	This is common sense to me, but I think like a horse. So I always ask myself, if I was a horse what would I like or dislike. I would like to be able to relax after any long trailer ride, get some water, see my new area with my leader and make mental notes of danger areas or areas that concern me, new things and areas where things can jump out and possibly eat me.<br>
																	<br>
																	So, when introducing a horse to new areas there are many things to consider. I will list some things to be aware of and to consider below:<br>
																	<br></p>
																	<div class="indented">
																		Arrive in day light, easier for horse to see and adjust<br>
																		<br>
																		Make sure your horse has time to get his bearing and ground legs after long trailer rides<br>
																		<br>
																		Don't just take out of trailer at new location and throw horse into new area with new horses<br>
																		<br>
																		Feed light so the horse is not too hungry and will not be trying to eat when scared or working into herd<br>
																		<br>
																		Don't feed a lot since stress can cause colic and the horse will be more active &amp; stressed at new place<br>
																		<br>
																		Good fresh water available and the horse knows where it is<br>
																		<br>
																		Maybe a holding pen or round pen to put horse in alone so it can get settled before throwing into new herd<br>
																		<br>
																		If hot cool down and wet horse, small bath may cause him to roll at new place and get local scent on him<br>
																		<br>
																		Long trailer rides mess with ears, wind, dry eyes, hearing, stress legs, dust/respiration and hooves, be aware<br>
																		<br>
																		Some horses do better meeting with a fence between them, others do better to let them in herd<br>
																		<br>
																		Identify dangers in new pastures, fencing, horses with shoes, corners, choke points, bad fencing, barbed wire<br>
																		<br>
																		Maybe feed herd with several piles spread out of hay so they will eat and not all concentrate on new horse<br>
																		<br>
																		Walk horse around fencing so the horse will see poles, fence, holes, obstacles and know boundaries<br>
																		<br>
																		No fly mask at new places, obstructs vision, same with blankets<br>
																		<br>
																		Don't leave horse, walk in with herd, let horse get settled before you drop off and abandon<br>
																		<br>
																		Maybe tie horse to trailer for a while, give some hay, let him check out things from a place he knows<br>
																		<br>
																		Keep all the new people from gathering, crowding, wanting to see and putting pressure on horse<br>
																		<br>
																		Slow is fast, don't be or get into a hurry<br>
																		<br>
																		If horse is alone then don't leave, they will be very insecure, nervous and stressed<br>
																		<br>
																		Don't use flashlights or bright lights at night to see, it will blind horses (stop night vision) for over 30 mins<br>
																		<br>
																		Control things to keep clam and less chaotic, no rushing, slow is faster<br>
																		<br>
																		NO training or expecting a horse to be prefect or listen, the horse will be in fear and survival mode<br>
																		<br>
																		Be aware of new pressures, listen to your horse, they will talking so listen<br>
																		<br>
																		Understand your horses concerns and fears, don't try and fix them or teach the horse, less pressure
																		<p></p>
																	</div>
																	<p align="justify">Obviously this is a short list, many other things, but thinking like a horse, seeing the situation from the horse's perspective and knowing there will be confusion, fear and insecurity and that all of those things are normal, will help you be more confident and that will help your horse be more confident.</p>

																		<h3><strong><u>Is a Stallion Mean? Why should You Geld a horse?</u></strong></h3>
																	</center><strong><u></u></strong>
																</center>
																<p></p>
																<p align="justify">I discuss this in many videos but I wanted to cover this topic briefly. In today's world, there is NO place for Stallions. The only reason to have a Stallion and not a gelding, is for breeding. There are too many horses now that no one wants or can take care of. So why would idiots want to breed more horses? Money, ego, winning, all the things I show time and time again that is bad for horses.</p>
																<p align="justify">With all the land being used and taken over by man, there is not enough room to allow horses to free breed, meaning letting Stallions run free in herds and breed mares as they wish. Therefore, what happens now is people keep Stallions locked up, caged up, trapped, and boarded up in stalls. That makes a horse crazy and this done just so humans can breed the horse and sell a baby for profit.</p>
																<p align="justify">No horse is meant to be caged and for sure, NO Stallions are meant to be caged. If Stallions are allowed to be with herds, they take over, it is their nature, like they should and then people want to label them and kill them for being mean.</p>
																<p align="justify">Therefore, in my opinion, Stallions have NO place in today's world. The slaughterhouses are full, the rescues places are full, the open lands are over-crowded with Mustangs, so they are caught and killed, so why are people even thinking of keeping a Stallion? The answer is selfishness and money.</p>
																<p align="justify">If you keep a Stallion, you have to do lots of extra work to keep him locked in and to prevent him from breaking out and breeding, it is what they are born to do and their drive is so strong they will do anything to breed and that includes becoming dangerous.</p>
																<p align="justify">Geld your Stallion, and don't curse a horse to life of misery being caged, alone, trapped and locked up; forever preventing it from being a horse with a herd and friends.</p>

																	<br>

																	<br>

Today giving someone "free reins" means giving them the opportunity to make their own success or mistakes, letting them grow and be free.<br>
																	<br>
																	<strong>Straight from the horse's mouth =</strong> Horse racing tips were most trusted when they came from the people closest to the horse.

																	<br>
																	<strong>Gathering at the water hole =</strong> Getting a drink is a social an event for horses, so when the herd moves to water they drink together, relax, cool off and watch out for each other. In the old days people would refer to getting together socially as gathering at the water hole. Later this has evolved into gathering at the water cooler since people working in offices gather at the cooler to relax, get a drink and socialize. Now this term is still used when people meet a bar for a drink. Another small way horses have touched our lives with lessons.<br>
																	<br>
																	<strong>Kick his ass =</strong> This term is still used to beat down someone or show someone who is boss or teach someone some manners. This came from the horse since when horses were plentiful, everyone had one and they were a huge part of humans. So when horses fight they kick each other in the butt. They do this to teach lessons, to gain respect or show dominance. So over the years the term has stuck and is still used today.<br>
																	<br>
																	<strong>Barn Witch =</strong> someone that hangs out at barns and stirs the pot/kettle, creates problems, flies around on a broom since they cannot ride a horse, cast spells of evil on those that disagree with them, trouble makers, thinks gossip gives them power, bullies, likes to write on white boards and leave notes, cannot ride a horse but wants to tell everyone else how they should ride, took lessons at age two, watched a video on horse training, won a ribbon when they were 12, have owned horses their whole lives, has lots of excuses on why they do not ride anymore, cannot show or demonstrate anything they say you should do, really good at talking and giving advice, main purpose is to bring evil to others behind their back, know-it-alls, always willing to give free and unwanted advice</p>

																	<strong>Home remedies for Horses:</strong>
																</center><br>
																<br>
																<strong>Honey</strong> Use it for: Minor cuts and burns, cough or sore throat How it works: Most of us have tried honey in tea to soothe a scratchy throat, but it's also been used to treat wounds for thousands of years. Last year, a review of research found that honey helps heal minor to moderate burns, and a recent Dutch study identified a protein called defensin-1 that gives the goo its antibacterial action. Try this: Apply warm honey to a minor cut or mild burn, then put a gauze bandage on top; change the dressing daily. However, if you have a burn or wound accompanied by swelling, fever, or pain, check with a doctor instead; it may require oral antibiotics.<br>
																<br>
																<strong>Meat tenderizer</strong> Use it for: Bee stings, nonpoisonous spider bites - How it works: Meat tenderizer contains papain, an enzyme that breaks down proteins (like the ones in your T-bone steak). Papain can also break down toxins from bug bites and cut back on itching, Dr. Schaffran says. Note: Use tenderizer only on mosquito bites, bee stings, and nonpoisonous spider bites. If you experience symptoms such as nausea, difficulty breathing, or cramping in your abs or lower back, seek medical help immediately. Try this: Mix a small amount of meat tenderizer with water to make a paste and apply to the bite. Leave on for 10 to 15 minutes, then rinse with warm water.<br>
																<br>
																<strong>Oatmeal</strong> Use it for: Eczema, sunburn, hives How it works: Oats pack phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory properties that soothe itchy and inflamed skin, a study in the Archives of Dermatological Research shows. Most MDs recommend using the finely ground colloidal type sold in drugstores, but any unflavored oatmeal will help. Try this: If you're using regular oatmeal, grind it into a fine powder, Dr. Schaffran says. Put a cup of oats through a food processor until they dissolve easily into a glass of water. Pour the solution into a bathtub full of warm water and soak for 15 minutes. Using colloidal oats? Just sprinkle them into the tub and say ahhh.<br>

																	<strong>Apple Cider Vinegar with Mothers</strong>
																</center><br>
																<br>
																This is has good things for stupid humans, horses and other animals. I have reprinted an article below that will shed some light on the benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar with Mothers, remember when you buy it look for the term "mother". This vinegar will be more cloudy and will have sediment collected at the bottom of the jar, so you have to shake it before use. I periodically put some apple cider vinegar (with mother) in my horses water bucket. I would think the sun would affect this so I do not fill water bucket when I add this, I put enough for the horses to get one or two drinks and have another water source available in case they need more water.<br>
																<br>
																Vinegar is said to help them in many ways like helping with flies, hair, skin, immune system and other benefits. LESS IS MORE. Like most things with horses do NOT over use or over do this, too much of anything is not good. Check with you vet if you have any questions or do your own research. I also use vinegar for cleaning my silk scarves after I wash them to remove any soap residue. I some time use it in my horses hooves to helps prevent or stop beginning thrush. I have a link below for other uses.<br>

																	<strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not drink or give your horse undiluted apple cider vinegar it can erode teeth enamel.

																<b>Detox and Cleanse with Raw Apple Cider Vinegar</b><br>
																<br>
																(NaturalNews) The cleansing properties of apple cider vinegar have been utilized for centuries. Eastern medicine teaches us that apple cider vinegar can help stimulate circulation and aid detoxification in the liver. Ancient cultures often used apple cider vinegar to purify the blood. Today we are exposed to more toxins than ever before, so it's become even more important that we take care of our bodies by detoxing with natural medicinal foods like apple cider vinegar.<br>
																<br>
																Apple cider vinegar is rich in natural minerals, vitamins and enzymes. Supplying these nutrients to the body is crucial during a time of detoxification, when all the systems in the body go into overdrive to purge out toxic material. The unique acids in apple cider vinegar can bind to toxins and help the body eliminate them more effectively. They are also equip to fight bacteria, fungus and Candida.<br>
																<br>
																Another way apple cider vinegar aids detoxification is by breaking up mucus throughout the body and cleansing the lymph nodes to allow for better lymph circulation. A healthy lymphatic system can remove toxins from the cells in the body while improving immune system response.<br>
																<br>
																Taking apple cider vinegar before meals aids digestion and improves gastric health, helping the body remove toxic waste more efficiently. When foods are digested thoroughly and waste eliminated quickly, the body is nourished and toxins are removed before they have time to do damage.<br>
																<br>
																Remember, to get real results you must choose a real product. The ideal apple cider vinegar is in raw liquid form. It should be unprocessed and unfiltered, with plenty of "mother" in it. Any other kind of apple cider vinegar will be far less effective and may provide no benefits at all. In fact, some cheap imitations are simply white distilled vinegar with caramel coloring added!<br>
																<br>
																Take apple cider vinegar in small doses throughout the day. Many people like to take 1-3 teaspoons in a glass of water before meals to aid digestion. Others enjoy adding it to hot water with honey to drink as a tea. You can also use apple cider vinegar to make tasty and nutritious sauces and salad dressings.<br>
																<br>
																A hot bath prepared with a cup of apple cider vinegar and a cup of Epsom salts will draw toxins out through the skin and help jumpstart the cleansing process. This can also help relieve joint pain as well as skin conditions like eczema and acne.<br>
																<br>
																While apple cider vinegar can play an important role in detoxification, it will be far more effective when combined with a naturally healthy lifestyle that includes these habits:<br>
																<br>
																- Eat a balanced diet that consists of unprocessed, natural foods that will provide the body with the nutrition it needs to purify itself.<br>
																<br>
																- Include some raw, uncooked foods in your diet since these supply important enzymes that will help you detox.<br>
																<br>
																- Choose organic foods to help reduce your exposure to toxins. Keep in mind processed foods of all kinds should be avoided, even if they are labeled organic.<br>
																<br>
																- Exercise regularly to improve the health of the circulatory and lymphatic systems, both of which work to cleanse and purify the body.<br>
																<br>
																- Reduce toxin exposure by using natural household cleaners and beauty products.<br>
																<br>
																- Drink only filtered water to avoid potential toxin exposure. Getting plenty of pure water will also aid natural detoxification processes.<br>

																<strong>Another Article about Vinegar:</strong><br>
																<br>
																I was first introduced to apple cider vinegar (ACV for short) several years ago after reading in a magazine that Fergie (Black Eyed Peas, not Duchess of York) takes a couple of teaspoons each day to assist weight loss. A body like Fergie by drinking apple cider vinegar? That is one bandwagon I was quick to jump on. While I'm still waiting for Fergie-like abs, I have been reaping the many other health benefits associated with including a little ACV in my diet. ACV has been touted for it many medicinal properties for yonks and it really is a cure-all remedy.<br>
																<br>
																These are just a few benefits of apple cider vinegar<br>
																<br>
																1. Detoxification<br>
																<br>
																Being rich in natural minerals, vitamins and enzymes makes apple cider vinegar a great addition to any detox. The unique acids in apple cider vinegar can bind to toxins and help the body eliminate them more effectively. Apple cider vinegar can also help to stimulate circulation and aid detoxification in the liver. In ancient cultures ACV was often used to purify the blood. Another way apple cider vinegar aids detoxification is by breaking up mucus throughout the body and cleansing the lymph nodes to allow for better lymph circulation. A healthy lymphatic system can remove toxins from the cells in the body while improving immune system response.<br>
																<br>
																2. To promote weight loss<br>
																<br>
																Apple cider vinegar may aid in weight loss by stabilizing the blood sugar for a longer period and helping to control the appetite. Try taking 1-2 teaspoons in water before each meal. This little trick may also help with diabetes. Don't just rely on ACV to help you trim down though. It won't work if your diet is rubbish. ACV should be an accompaniment to a healthy, balanced diet.<br>
																<br>
																3. To help with digestion<br>
																<br>
																Aiding digestion is possibly one of apple cider vinegar's biggest claims to fame. It can help with common indigestion and gastrointestinal discomfort caused by certain foods and it is said to clear up chronic acid reflux when taken religiously with each meal.<br>
																<br>
																4. To alleviate skin problems<br>
																<br>
																Apple cider vinegar can be used as a topical astringent for acne prone skin, and some even report that taking ACV orally every day has helped clear their skin. Add a cup of apple cider vinegar and a cup of Epsom salts to a hot bath to draw toxins out through the skin and help jumpstart the cleansing process. This can also help relieve joint pain as well as skin conditions like eczema and acne.<br>
																<br>
																5. To get rid of warts<br>
																<br>
																Try this for a home wart removal remedy: Soak a cotton ball with apple cider vinegar and attach it to the wart site with a band aid. Leave overnight. Repeat each night until the wart disappears.<br>
																<br>
																6. Helps ward off sickness<br>
																<br>
																Apple cider vinegar devotees claim that this miracle elixir is one of the main reasons they are able to ward of common illnesses. This can most likely be chalked up to ACV's unique blend of vitamins, minerals and enzymes. It also possesses antimicrobial and antiseptic properties.<br>
																<br>
																7. For soft and shiny hair<br>
																<br>
																Acetic acid, the main ingredient in ACV, will remove build up from styling products and conditioners and strengthen the hair shaft, leaving you with soft, shiny strands. It will also balance hair's pH level, kill bacteria, and is a cure for dandruff.<br>
																<br>
																Dilute 1/3 cup ACV in 4 cups of water and pour over your hair after shampooing. Leave it in for a few seconds before rinse your hair using cold water to seal the hair shaft and create more shine. Because vinegar is acidic, using the rinse daily is not advised. And no, your hair won't stink like vinegar - the smell will go away after your hair dries.<br>
																<br>
																How to take it orally<br>
																<br>
																Add 1-3 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to a glass of warm or cool water before each meal. You can also add it to hot water with a little honey and drink it as a tea. Apple cider vinegar is also great as a salad dressing when mixed with flaxseed oil and honey.<br>
																<br>
																It's important to buy an apple cider vinegar that is organic and unfiltered so that all of its nutritional value is in tact. The Bragg's brand is great. The hazy looking stuff that settles to the bottom is called "the mother" and it is said to be the most nutritious part of the apple cider vinegar for its therapeutic benefits.<br>

																	<strong>Mule verses Horse; Which is Better?</strong>
																</center>
																<p></p>
																<p align="justify">I am asked many questions about Mules. The most common question I get is which is better a Mule or a Horse? I will address this issue from what I have been told, but like most horse questions, It Depends.<br>
																<br>
																A mule is the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse.<br>
																<br>
																I have had many people that own a mule, tell me once you ride a mule you will never want to ride a horse again. On the other hand, I have horse people tell me, a horse is much better than a mule.<br>
																<br>
																The good that people say about mules are; they tend to be more sure footed, have harder hooves and will never need shoes, they think more than horses and are not as reactionary, they are more loyal to one person and will not work for others like they will for their owner, they are stronger than a horse and can carry more weight since their bone mass is heavier. What one person sees as a thinker, another may see as stubborn. Hence the term, stubborn as a mule. This is because mules are thinkers and cannot be bullied into training like horses can, since they are considered more intelligent and thinkers.<br>
																<br>
																The Bad that people say about mules are; they are slower and harder to get to work, they are not as smooth as a horse, they will not push for you and will stop, they question you and won't go through anything like a horse will, you can't lead a mule like you can a horse, they are harder to get into a canter and will take a lot longer to speed up or slow down. Mules tend to be more territorial than horses. If smaller animals like dogs, sheep or goats get into a mules area he may chase it down, stomp it or bite and throw it. Horses tend to be more forgiving than mules. A mule will remember if you mistreat it and payback will delivered sometime in the future.<br>
																<br>
																So, is one better or worse than the other, it depends.<br>
																<br>
																A horse will go from a dead stop to full canter, in general a mule will have to walk, walk faster, trot slow, trot faster, then get up to a canter. A horse will work and go until it drops dead and will not tell you NO. A mule will not work past what it knows is enough or unhealthy, a mule will say when it has had enough and will stop. Horses react more since flight is their first choice for survival. Mules tend to think and decide to fight or run. A mule will fight before a horse will. Some say anyone can train a horse, but you better be real good with horses before you try and train a mule. Mules tend to be more accurate with their feet, when walking or kicking. Mules have harder hooves than horses. If you corner a horse he will rear or try and run away, a mule is more likely to push or fight back if you corner him. A mule will not do for others what it will do for it's owner. Mules tend to be one person loyal, this can be good or bad. Some say a horse is smoother to ride, others say a mule is smoother to ride. Horses are more vocal than mules, so a horse may call to his friends, a mule will not. A mule is a litter faster than a horse, but it will take longer to reach that top speed and a little longer to stop. Mules tend to live longer and have fewer problems than horses. You can normally ride a mule to an older age than a horse. Mules tend to think and not over eat like horses, so founder and other feeding problems tend to be less. Mules tend to be more intelligent than a horse since they think about their own safety. Which is why they stop working before over heating, or they will not be pushed to a limit that harms them.<br>
																<br>
																Now with all that said, any horse or mule could be good or bad or better or worse, it depends on many factors. Therefore, for me or anyone else to tell you which is better is being dishonest and bias. The answer to the question, which is better a Horse or Mule? The answer is, It Depends.</p>

																	<strong>Do Horses Like Rusty Bits?</strong>
																</center>
																<p></p>
																<p align="justify"> Does this really need to be answered? Apparently so since if you google it you get 100 hits with stupid comments about horses like rusty, rough, flaking, nasty rusty metal bits. Of course, there are always the idiots that repeat what they heard and want to sound smart and bring up sweet iron bits. I will cover this more but the short answer is "Hell no a horse does not like a rough, sharp, rusty, nasty piece of metal in their sensitive mouth."<br>
																<br>
																This may shock all the dummies that have telling people horses like rust.<br>
																<br>
																Like most things when ignorant people say things like this I say - put it in your mouth and see if you like it.<br>
																<br>
																Another tip for blind - is if rusty bits were so GREAT - why wouldn't manufactures of bits sell them? We call that a clue in the real world. No one sells rusty bits- ask yourself why? Perhaps if they make a Pink rusty bit, it would sell, but only an idiot would buy it.<br>
																<br>
																This philosophy is another way to justify lazy and ignorant behavior. Only the foolish think it works better since it is rougher, taste like crap and hurts the horse more causing tears and cuts up the sensitive soft tissue in the horse's mouth. The unknowing see the horse respond better and faster, so if the horse appears to respond faster, since it hurts more, then it must be better - sharp rusting metal causes abrasions in the horse's mouth and gums - only a blind person could not see this.<br>
																<br>
																When someone brings up a sweet iron bit has a sweet taste for the horse - this was a belief in the 30's and 40's - as far as I know, there was never a talking a horse that said "I like a rough rusty metal pain bit in my mouth and it taste good."<br>
																<br>
																Many bit uses never look in their horse's mouth and will never the sores, cuts, bleeding gums and torn tissue in the horse's mouth. However, these same people will be the ones claiming their horse likes it.<br>
																<br>
																Another foolish misconception is a rusty bit makes a horse salivate and it helps promote salivation. No shit - if I put something nasty in your mouth you will salivate, spit and not want to swallow the rancid taste - that is why a horse appears to salivate when you put a nasty rusty bit in their mouth. Again, people will justify ignorance with ignorance.<br>
																<br>
																Luckily most horses are vaccinated against tetanus (all horses should get a yearly booster), no telling how many horses are ingesting rust, which is the primary and greatest cause of Tetanus. Here is a thought, if rusty bits are better, then rusty nails should be better when putting on shoes since the rought rust will help the nails stay in better. I hope that that sounds as ignorant as it is. This same type of ignorant argument is used by horse people to lazy to clean their horses water so they say horses like dirty nasty water with fish and moss in it? Stop repeating ignorance.<br>
																<br>
																Of course, when the dummies that have been promoting this ignorance read this they will have 1000 excuses why they are right and my logic and common sense is not right. Think for yourself, treat your horse like you would like to be treated, and if it sounds stupid, it probably is. Learn how to think and stop listening to those that tell you what to think.<br>
																<br>
																In closing, if you think your horse likes something, then try it first, if you don't like it, won't drink it, or think it hurts, then I assure you, your horse feels the same way.</p>

Why Do Horses Run Back Into A Barn That Is On Fire<p></p></u></strong></center>
<center>

<p align="justify"> 
This saying has been around for years.  If your barn is on fire, once you get the horses out make sure and close the door or the horses will run back in.  They someone says horses are stupid to run into a burning barn. <br><br>
So what is really going on is conditioning of the horse.  A horse loves freedom and was never meant to be locked up and caged in cells, I mean stalls.  Horse are the Masters of adaption. They adapt, learn, accept and don't fight back.  Which is why they attract weak people and bullies that like to control and abuse them because they don't fight back.  <br><br>

So when a horse is caged, locked up and forced to be kept in cells, they adapt.  The accept it and are forced to find comfort and security in their cells.  This is the same reasons horses attack people from their stalls, they have no control of their life or freedom, so the only thing they can control is their little cell, so they get protective and possessive.  This causes them to lash out of anyone by their stalls as a way not to lose the only place they can control and have been conditioned to connect it with safety and security.  It is a cruel life for a horse, but they have no choice.<br><br>

So when a barn is on fire and stupid humans are running screaming grabbing horses and just letting them lose outside the barn and screaming and panic is in the air, the horse feel this.  So what do horses do 90 percent of their life, they seek comfort and security and a safe place. So when the horse is let free in chaos, he immediately seeks comfort and safety, which to him, is his own cell that he has been forced to live in.  So he runs back to his stall and back into a burning building.  Just like if scared a horse will run over a cliff to his death if he is being chased or scared for his life. <br><br>

Horses do not see around corners, they do look three moves ahead, they do not evaluate the consequences of their actions, and they act with FLIGHT to save their life.  From the time they are born they know to run from fear and danger and do not think about it or you will die.  This is why I always say when a horse gets hurt because stupid humans put the horse in a bad situation, the horse is only being a horse and that is all he knows how to be.
